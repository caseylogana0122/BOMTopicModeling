"THE BOOK OF PUKEI. Chap. 1. 1. And it came to pass in the latter days, that wickedness did much abound in the land,and the Idle and slothful said one to another, let us send for Walters the Magician, who hasstrange books, and deals with familiar spirits; peradventurehe will inform us where the Nephites, hid their treasure, so be it, that we and our vagabond van, do not perish for lack of sustenance. 2. Now Walters, the Magician, was a man unseemly to look upon, and to profound ignorance added the most consummate impudence, he obeyed the summons of the idle and slothful, and produced an old book in an unknown tongue, (Cicero's Orations in latin,) from whence he read in the presence of the Idle and Slothful strange stories of hidden treasures and of ho had the custody thereof. 3. And the Idle and Slothful paid tribute unto the Magician, and besought him saying, Oh! thou who art wise above all men, and can interpret the book that no man understandeth, and can discover hidden things by the power of thy enchantments, lead us, we pray thee to the place where the Nephites buried their treasure, and give us power over �the spirit,� and we will be thy servants forever. 4. And the Magician led the rabble into a dark grove, in a place called Manchester, where after drawing a Magic circle, with a rusty sword, and collecting his motley crew of latterdemallions, within the centre, he sacrificed a Cock (a bird sacred to Minerva) for the purpose of propiciating the prince of spirits. 5. All things being ready, the Idle and Slothful fell to work with a zeal deserving a better cause, and many a live long night was spent in digging for �the root of all evil.� Howbeit, owing to the wickedness and hardness of their hearts, these credulous and ignorant knaves, were always disappointed, till finally, their hopes, although frequently on the eve [36] of consummation�like that of he hypocrite perished, and their hearts became faint within them. 7. And it came to pass, that when the Idle and Slothful became weary of their nightly labors, they said one to another, lo! this imp of the Devil, hath deceived us, let us no more of him, or peradventure, ourselves, our wives, and our little ones, will become chargeable on the town. 8. Now when Walters the Magician heard these things, he was sorely grieved, and said unto himself, lo! mine occupation is gone, even these ignorant vagabonds, the idl eand [idle and] slothful detect mine impostures. I will away and hide myself, lest the strong arm of the law should bring me to justice. 9. And he took his book, and his rusty sword, and his magic stone, and his stuffed Toad, and all his implements of witchcraft and retired to the mountains near Great Sodus Bay, where he holds communion with the Devil, even unto this day. 10. Now the rest of the acts of the magician, how his mantle fell upon the prophet Jo. Smith Jun. and how Jo. made a league with the spirit, who afterwards turned out to be an angel, and how he obtained the Gold Bible, Spectacles, and breast plate will they not be faithfully recorded in the book of Pukei?"
"An Extract. MEN OF UNDERSTANDING.This title distinguished a denomination which appeared in Flanders and Brussels, in the year 1511. They owed their origin to an illiterate manwhose name was Egidus Cantor, and to William of Henderison, a Carmilite Monk. They pretended to be honoured with celestial visions; denied that any could arrive at a perfect knowledge of the Holy Scriptures without the extraordinary succours of a divine illumination, and declared the approach of a new revelation from heaven, more perfect than the Gospel of Christ. How does this tally with the pretensions of Jo Smith Jr. and his followers ha?"
"BLASPHEMY BOOK OF MORMON, alias THE GOLDEN BIBLE. The Book of Mormon has been placed in our hands. A viler imposition was never practised. It is an evidence of fraud, blasphemy and credulity, shocking to the Christian and moralist. The author and proprietor is one  Joseph Smith, jr. a fellow who, by some hocus pocus, acquired such an influence over a wealthy farmer of Wayne county, that the latter mortgaged his farm for $ 3000, which he paid for printing and binding 5000 copies of the blasphemous work. The volume consists of about 600 pages, and is divided into the books of Nephi, of Jacob, of Mosiah, of Alma, of Mormon, of Ether, and of Helaman. Copy right secured! The style of the work may be conjectured from the � preface� and � testimonials� which we subjoin. . . ."
"CAUTION AGAINST THE GOLDEN BIBLE. The editor of the Palmyra Freeman declared in his paper of August 11th, as follows:--  The Golden Bible is the greatest piece of superstition that has ever come within the sphere of our knowledge. In the Investigator, No. 12, Dec. 11, I published, by way of caution, a letter of Oliver H. P. Cowdry, in answer to my letter to Joseph Smith, Jun. Martin Harris, and David Whitmore the believers in said bible of gold plates which they affirm they have miraculously, or supernaturally beheld. I sought for evidences, and such as could not be disputed, of the existence of this bible of golden plates. But the answer was the world must take their words for its existence; and that the book would appear this month. The editor of the Palmyra Freeman, their neighbor, adds to the above, that  in the fall of 1827, Joseph Smith, of Manchester, Ontario county, reported he had been visited in a dream by the spirit of the Almighty, and informed, that in a certain hill, in that town, was deposited this Golden Bible, containing an ancient record of a divine nature and origin. After being thrice visited thus, as he states, he proceeded to the spot, and found the bible, with a huge pair of spectacles. He had been directed, however, not to let any mortal being examine them [ i. e. the plates and the stone- eyed spectacles] under no less penalty than instant death!! It was said that the leaven of the bible were plates of gold, about eight inches long, six inches wide, and one- eighth of an inch thick. [ i. e. 8 plates are one inch thick, 8 long and 6 wide.] On these plates were characters, or hieroglyphics, engraved.� The whole of the plates are said to weigh about thirty pounds; which would be in gold near eight thousand dollars, beside the value of the engraving. One of Joseph Smiths proselytes, is, continues the Palmyra Freeman,  Martin Harris, an honest and industrious farmer of Palmyra. He is said to have shown some of these characters to Professor Samuel L. Mitchell, of this city, who could not translate them. Martin Harris returned, and set Joseph Smith to the business of translating them: who, � by placing the spectacles in a hat and looking into them, Joseph Smith said he could interpret these characters. The editor of the Palmyra Freeman describes Joseph Smith as not being very literate: and that his translation is pronounced,  by his proselytes, to be superior in style, and more advantageous to mankind than our holy bible!� I have this month received sixteen pages of this work, from page 353 to 368 inclusive. I cannot perceive any superiority of style in this specimen; nor any evidence that this bible is not a book of Joseph Smith�s own manufacture. His title page professed that he was the author of it; and this declaration is evidenced by its style. For in these sixteen pages, I noticed ` yea� was repeated 34 times; and even 21 times in two pages. The words, ` It came to pass,� is repeated 56 times in 16 pages, and even ten times on one page. ` Now� and ` behold,� are reiterated near the commencement of sentences, full thirty times apiece, and more, in these sixteen pages. Consequently these four things are repeated 162 times on the ear- drum, while speaking of the war of the Nephites and Lemanites, in the day of Moroni, and reign of the judges, according to the Book of Alma. Thus, in page 359, it is written�� Yea, verily, verily, I say unto you, if all men had been, and were, and ever would be, like unto Moroni� yea, the devil would never have no power over the hearts of the children of men: [ never to have no power, is ever to have some power.] Behold, he was a man like unto Ammon, the son of Mosiah; yea, and even the other sons of Mosiah; yea, and also, Alma and his sons.� Whether this style is equal to our scripture style, the reader can judge. Again, in pages 353 & 4, it reads thus: � And those who died in the faith of Christ are happy in him, as we must needs suppose.� That a weak faith ends this sentence, is manifest. Again, page 353, is written�� And there was but few which denied the covenant of freedom.� Was should have been were.� Again: � And there were some who died with fevers, which at some seasons of the year, was [ were] very frequent. Again, in the next page�� And it came to pass that they would not, or the MORE part, would not obey,� & c. The following is the title page of the Golden Bible, as published in the Palmyra Freeman:-- � The Book of Mormon, an account, written by the hand of Mormon upon plates, taken from the plates of Nephi:� � Wherefore it is an abridgment of the record of the people of Nephi, and also of the Lamanites, written to the Lamanites, which are a remnant of the house of Israel: and also to Jew and Gentile; written by way of commandment, and also by the spirit of prophecy and of revelation; written and sealed and hid up unto the Lord, that they might not be destroyed.� to come forth by the gift and power of God unto the interpretation thereof� sealed up by the hand of Moroni, and hid up unto the Lord, to come forth in due time by way of the Gentile-- the interpretation thereof by the gift of God: an abridgment taken from the book of Ether.� Also, which is a record of the people of Jared, which were scattered at the time the Lord confounded the language of the people, when they were building a tower to get to Heaven; which is to shew unto the remnant of the house of Israel how great things the Lord hath done for their fathers: and that they may know the covenants of the Lord, that they are not cast off forever: and also to the convincing of the Jew and Gentile that Jesus is the Christ, the Eternal God, manifesting himself unto all nations. And now, if there by fault, it be the mistake of men: wherefore condemn not the things of God, that ye may be found spotless at the judgment seat of Christ.-- By JOSEPH SMITH, Junior, Author and Proprietor.� Thus we are informed that this Book of Mormon was written [ i. e. engraved] by the hand of Mormon, on plates taken from the plates of Nephi;-- wherefore it is [ not a transcript, but what a strange conclusion] an abridgement of the record of Nephi, & c. If so, why is it not called the record of Nephi? But what is also strange, this record is � written by way of commandment, and also [ and or also is here useless] by the spirit of prophecy and of revelation;� [ what an uncommon record of past and known events to the Nephites!] � sealed and hid up unto the Lord; sealed up by the hand of Moroni� an abridgement taken from the book of Ether. [Instead of being hid up, it was hid down in the earth of a hill, or in a stone reservoir. It was first said to be an abridgement of the record of Nephi, but it is now said to be an abridgement taken from the book of Ether.]� Also which is a record of the people of Jared, & c. to teach Jew and Gentile, that Jesus is the Christ, the Eternal God. But lastly, Joseph Smith, jun. declares he is the author of this book of Mormon, this record of Nephi, this book of Ether, this record of Jared�s people, who were scattered at the building of the tower of Babel; this convincing work, which is to convert Jew and Gentile to believe that Jesus is the eternal God. Surely our missionaries should take notice of this! Now if there be fault, it be the mistake of men, says J. S. This title page is another specimen of superior style, in which one is soon lost and wonders what J. Smith means; or how can all that is written by the author be true! These facts are given to caution people not to spend their money uselessly for a book, that is more probable a hoax or a money- making speculation or an enthusiastic delusion, than a revelation of facts by the Almighty. C. C. BLATCHLY."
"DIABOLICAL. Our readers must be aware of the great difficulty we labor under in translating our foreign correspondence. The inspired man who wrote the Gold Bible on plates of brass, in the reformed Egyptian language, on account of its brevity, as we are informed, through the medium of one of these psuedo prophets, never had half the trouble that we experience in deciphering the unseemly scrolls of this dark representative of old Plutos dominions. His letters and communications are all written in heathen Greek, and the characters so fine and imperfect, that notwithstanding the great power of our editorial spectacles, we have in one instance burnt the scrawl in despair! But behold what followed! The room (our bower,) was immediately filled with the fumes of brimstone, and we thought frequently that we could detect something like sulphuric acid, in the composition; and to cap the climax, we hard a crack, like that of a coachmans whip, which made us conclude that old sooty himself, had snapped his tail at us. We shall be more careful in future. One great difficulty in transcribing the manuscript of this imp, who appears to bear the whimsical name of Snuffer, (when �done into English,�) is, his (strange as it may seem) ignorance of letters. From the knowledge we possess on this subject, we are bold to declare, that in our opinion, the chief scribe of the �Book of Mor-[66]mon� does not possess less knowledge in either spelling or punctuation; and was it not that we, in a measure, stand pledged to �drag the deeds of darkness to the light of day, we should exchange this unpleasant task for one of a more pleasing nature, to wit: that of writing a true, genuine, and authentic history of �the captivity, dispersion, trials, hardships, sufferings, and final restoration of the ten lost tribes of Israel, who have not been heard of for more than two thousand years, with traits of character, matrimonial customs, anecdotes, &c.; of all which, not one word will be borrowed from the Cabala of the Jews, the Bible of the Gentiles, the books of Cybals, or the works of a celebrated Chinese philosopher, whose life we have a great itching also to write. But we have put our hands to the plough, and must not look black. We are pledged to stand forth the champion of a people thirsting after truth, [office,] and their necessities must and shall be attended to, without any reference to our individual propensities. . . ."
"GOLDEN BIBLE The Palmyra Freeman says The greatest piece of superstition that has ever come within our knowledge, now occupies the attention of a few individuals of this quarter. It is generally known and spoken of as the Golden Bible. Its proselytes give the following account of it In the fall of 1827, a person by the name of Joseph Smith, of Manchester, Ontario county, reported that he had been visited in a dream by the spirit of the Amighty and informed that in a certain hill in that town, was deposited this Golden Bible, containing an ancient record of a divine nature and origin After having been thrice thus visited, as he states, he proceeded to the spot, and after penetrating mother earth a short distance, the Bible was found, together with a huge pair of spectacles! He had been directed, however, not to let any mortal being examine them, under no less penalty than instant death! They were therefore nicely wrapped up and excluded from the vulgar gaze of poor wicked mortals!� It was said that the leaves of the bible were plates of gold, about 8 inches long, 6 wide, and one eighth of an inch thick, on which were engraved characters or hyeroglyphics. By placing the spectacles in a hat, and looking into it, Smith could (he said so, at least,) interpret these characters. An account of this discovery was soon circulated. The subject was almost invariably treated as it should have been�with contempt. A few, however, believed the �golden� story, among whom was Martin Harris, an honest and industrious farmer of this town, (Palmyra). So blindly enthusiastic was Harris, that he took some of the characters interpreted by Smith, and went in search of some one besides the interpreter, who was learned enough to English them; but all to whom he applied (among the number was Professor Mitchell, of New York) happened not to be possessed of sufficient knowledge to give satisfaction! Harris returned, and set Smith to work at interpreting the Bible. He has at length performed the task, and the work is soon to be put to press in Palmyra. Its language and doctrine are said to be far superior to those of the book of life!!!"
"IMPOSITION AND BLASPHEMY!! MONEYDIGGERS, & c. Some months ago a noise was made among the credulous of the earth, respecting a wonderful production said to have been found as follows. An ignoramous near Palmyra, Wayne county, pretended he had found some Gold Plates, as he is pleased to call them, upon which is said to be engraved characters of marvelous and misunderstandable import, which he, nor no other mortal could divine. These characters he has translated into the English language, and lo! they appear to be no other than the mysticisms of an unrevealed Bible! A person more credulous or more cunning, than him who found the plates, ordered the translation thereof, mortgaged his farm, sold all he had, and appropriated it to the printing and binding of several thousand copies of this pearl, which is emphatically of GREAT PRICE! The book comes before the public under the general title of the  Book of Mormon, arranged under different heads, something as follows. The book of Mormon� containing the books of Nephi, Nimshi, Pukei, and Buckeye� and contains some four or five hundred pages. It comes out under the � testimony of three witnesses,� and of � six witnesses,� who say they � have seen and hefted the plates,� that � they have the appearance of gold,� and that divers and strange characters are � imprinted on them.� The author, who has the � copy- right secured according to law,� says, � that he was commanded of the Lord in a dream,� to go and find, and that he went and found. At one time it was said that he was commanded of the Lord not to show the plates, on pain of instant death� but it seems he has shown them to the said witnesses, and yet is alive! At another time it is said that none could see them but he who was commanded;� that though they should lie in the middle of the street beneath the broad glare of the meridian sun, in the presence of hundreds, yet no eye but his could see them! The translator if we take his word for it, has been directed by an angel in this business, for the salvation and edification of the world! It partakes largely of Salem Witch- craft- ism, and Jemima Wilkinson- ism, and is in point of blasphemy and imposition, the very summit. But it is before the public, and can be had for money, at various places. This story brings to mind one of a similar nature once played off upon the inhabitants of Rochester and its vicinity, near the close of the last war. During the war, we were subject to many inconveniences at this place, and were in constant danger of attack from the enemy. Those who lived here at that time, can well remember the frequent attempts made by the enemy to land at the mouth of the Genesee, at which point our army had deposited heavy stores. Our village was then young, and the abodes of men were � few and far between.� If we remember aright, it was in the year 1815, that a family of Smiths moved into these parts, and took up their abode in a miserable hut on the east bank of the river, now near the late David K. Carter's tavern. They had a wonderful son, of about 18 years of age, who, on a certain day, as they said, while in the road, discovered a round stone of the size of a man's fist, the which when he first saw it, presented to him on the one side, all the dazzling splendor of the sun in full blaze� and on the other, the clearness of the moon. He fell down insensible at the sight, and while in the trance produced by the sudden and awful discovery, it was communicated to him that he was soon to become an oracle� and the keys of mystery were put into his hands, and he saw the unsealing of the book of fate. He told his tale for MONEY. Numbers flocked to him to test his skill, and the first question among a certain class was, if there was any of Kidd�s money hid in these parts of the earth. The oracle, after adjusting the stone in his hat, and looking in upon it sometime, pronounced that there was. The question of where, being decided upon, there forthwith emerged a set armed with � pick- axe, hoe and spade, out into the mountains, to dislodge the treasure. We shall mention but one man of the money- diggers. His name was Northrop. He was a man so unlike anything of refined human kind, that he might well be called a demi- devil sent forth upon the world to baffle the elements of despair, and wrestle with fate. As you will suppose, he was an enemy to all fear. Northrop and his men sallied out upon the hills east of the river, and commenced digging� the night was chosen for operation� already had two nights been spent in digging, and the third commenced upon, when Northrop with his pick- axe struck the chest! The effect was powerful, and contrary to an explicit rule laid down by himself he exclaimed, � d� m me, I've found it!"" The charm was broken!� the scream of demons, the chattering of spirits� and hissing of serpents, rent the air, and the treasure moved! The oracle was again consulted, who said that it had removed to the Deep Hollow. There, a similar accident happened� and again it was removed to a hill near the village of Penfield, where, it was pretended the undertakers obtained the treasure. About this time the enemy's fleet appeared off the mouth of the Genesee, and an attack at that point was expected� this produced a general alarm.� There are in all communities, a certain class, who do not take the trouble, or are not capable of thinking for themselves, and who, in cases of alarm, are ready to construe every thing mysterious or uncommon into omens of awful purport. This class flocked to the oracle. He predicted that the enemy would make an attack; and
that blood must flow. The story flew, and seemed to carry with it a desolating influence some moved away into other parts, and other were trembling under a full belief of the prediction. At this time a justice of the peace of the place visited the oracle, and warned him to leave the country. He gravely told the magistrate that any one who opposed him would receive judgements upon his head, and that he who should take away the inspired stone from him, would suffer immediate death! The magistrate, indignant at the fellow's impudence, demanded the stone, and ground it to power on a rock near by he then departed promising the family further notice. The result was the Smiths were missing the enemy did not land� the money diggers joined in the general execration, and declared that they had had their labor for their pains and all turned out to be a hoax! Now in reference to the two stories, put that to that, and they are a noble pair of brothers."
"Just about in this particular region, for some time past, much speculation has existed, concerning a pretended discovery, through superhuman means, of an ancient record, of a religious and a divine nature and origin, written in ancient characters, impossible to be interpreted by any to whom the special gift has not been imparted by inspiration. It is generally known and spoken of as the Golden Bible. Most people entertain an idea that the whole matter is the result of a gross imposition and a grosser superstition. It is pretended that it will be published as soon as the translation is completed. Meanwhile we have been furnished with the following, which is represented to us as intended for the title page of the work--we give it as a curiosity:��The Book of Mormon, an account, written by the hand of Mormon upon plates, taken from the plates of Nephi Wherefore it is an abridgment of the record of the people of Nephi, and also of the Lamanites, written to the Lamanites, which are a remnant of the house of Israel: and also to Jew and Gentile; written by way of commandment, and also by the spirit of prophecy and of revelation; written and sealed and hid up unto the Lord, that they might not be destroyed.�to come forth by the gift and power of God unto the interpretation thereof�sealed up by the hand of Moroni, and hid up unto the Lord, to come forth in due time by way of the Gentile�the interpretation thereof by the gift of God: an abridgment taken from the book of Ether. �Also, which is a record of the people of Jared, which were scattered at the time the Lord confounded the language of the people, when they were building a tower to get to Heaven; which is to shew unto the remnant of the house of Israel how great things the Lord hath done for their fathers: and that they may know the covenants of the Lord, that they are not cast off forever: and also to the convincing of the Jew and Gentile that Jesus is the Christ, the Eternal God, manifesting himself unto all nations. And now, if there by fault, it be the mistake of men: wherefore condemn not the things of God, that ye may be found spotless at the judgment seat of Christ.�By JOSEPH SMITH, Junior, Author and Proprietor�"
"OUR OWN AFFAIRS. BEWARE OF SECRET ASSOCIATIONS. We take the above quotation from the head of the editorial column, in the PALMYRA FREEMAN, and since we are informed that the DEVIL can quote scripture whenever it suits his purpose, we acknowledge that our astonishment is somewhat lessened. But where did the grave editor of the Freeman find this solemn warning? Has he been permitted to examine the hidden mysteries of the Book of Mormon? It appears hung up in double and treble capitals, with double commas, to prove, ( as we suppose, ) its authenticity; but the truth of it is, the quotation is not genuine, and probably originated in the muddy brain of Oliver Heartwell, who, we are informed, dreamed strange dreams and saw visions,� about the time he was carrying on a Literary correspondence with John Q. Adams. Be that as it may, we acknowledge we are a little surprised at the silence of the editorial fraternity, in general, on this subject, and can only account for it on the supposition that they considered it a forgery so palpable, that it needed no exposure; but this is entirely a mistaken opinion. Many an honest Anti- Mason has read the above quotation, and really supposed that those identical words fell from the hallowed lips of the venerable father of his country;� for such, and such alone, we now write: and in the first place, let us read what was said by � the first and best of men,� in his farewell to his constituents, and judge if the veracious editor of the FREEMAN has not, in his hurry of business, put his �saddle on the wrong horse.� It is our duty to detect fraud and falsehood wherever it may be found, and we intend to do it fearlessly.� �All COMBINATIONS and ASSOCIATIONS, under whatever plausible character, with the real design to direct, controul, counteract, or awe the regular deliberations and actions of the constituted authorities, are destructive of this fundamental principle, and of fatal tendency. They serve to organize faction.� We have attempted to quote this passage verbatim, and appeal to the document itself for the truth of our assertion. We could go much further, and as we humbly believe, convince every honest Anti-Mason that it is such men precisely, as the editor of the Freeman and other aspiring demagogues, which our beloved WASHINGTON wished to warn us to beware of; men who without the whirlwind of faction, which they attempt to raise and sometimes for the moment too well succeed� would be left to rot upon that dung-hill from whence they emanated. Real merit is always modest; not so with political Anti- Masonic leaders: (for we do not speak of honest well- meaning Anti-Masons, who know little about Masonry and care less:) they woo us as �the Lion woos his bride.��they thrust themselves upon us and by art or fraud attempt to persuade us that they were born to rule over us. May God forefend such dire calamity! Who did our country�s father mean, when he suggested that �cunning, ambitious, and unprincipled men might be enabled to subvert the power of the people and usurp for themselves the reins of Government; destroying afterwards the very engines which have lifted them to unjust dominion.� We shall close this article by suggesting the propriety of comparing notes, and attempting to get at the true meaning and import of the many warnings contained in the almost sacred document just quoted from, and before it is too late, learn the truth of an old proverb, that �the greatest thief cries first.� Should any of our learned readers be so short- sighted as to think that they discover any thing in our hasty remarks, that smells of party politics, any further than the cause of truth and justice is concerned, we must beg leave to tell them that they are mistaken. Like our Anti-Masonic brethren we wish to disseminate light, or in other words, to make darkness visible."
The Gold Bible, by Joseph Smith Junior, author and proprietor, is now in press and will shortly appear. Priestcraft is short lived.
GOLDEN BIBLE. A man by the name of Martin Harris was in this village a few days since endeavouring to make a contract for printing a large quantity of a work called the Golden Bible. He gave something like the following account of it.“In the autumn of 1827 a man named Joseph Smith of Manchester, in Ontario County, said that he had been visited by the spirit of the Almighty in a dream, and informed that in a certain hill in that town was deposited a Golden Bible, containing an ancient record of divine origin. He states that after the third visit from the same spirit in a dream he proceeded to the spot, removed earth, and there found the bible, together with a large pair of spectacles. He had also been directed to let no mortal see them under the penalty of immediate death, which injunction he steadfastly adheres to. The treasure consisted of a number of gold plates, about 8 inches long, 6 wide, and one eighth of an inch thick, on which were engraved hieroglyphics. By placing the spectacles in a hat and looking into it, Smith interprets the characters into the English language.[”]Harris states that he went in search of some one to interpret the hieroglyphics, but found that no one was intended to perform that all important task but Smith himself. Smith has interpreted the whole, and it is now in press in Palmyra, Wayne Co. The subject attracts a good deal of notice among a certain class, and as it will be ere long before the public, we shall endeavor to meet it with the comment it may deserve.
The Book of Mormon is expected to be ready for delivery in the course of one year. Great and marvellous things will “come to pass” about those days.
We understand that the Anti-Masons have declared war against the Gold Bible.—Oh! how impious.The number of the Gold Bible Apostles is said to be complete. Jo Smith Jr. is about to assign to each, a mission to the heathen.We understand that Abraham Chaddock intends to build the first house in Harris' New-Jerusalem.Some few evenings since, a man in the town of Mendon, had a loud call to go and preach the doctrines contained in the Gold Bible, under heavy denunciations.
The “Gold Bible” is fast gaining credit; the rapid spread of Islamism was no touch to it!
The “New-Jerusalem Reflector” states that the building of the TEMPLE OF NEPHI is to be commenced about the beginning of the first of the year of the Millennium. Thousands are already flocking to the standard of Joseph the Prophet. The Book of Mormon is expected to astonish the natives!!
GOLD BIBLE.A work bearing this cognomen is now in the Press; as much curiosity has been excited in this section of the country on the subject, and as the work Itself will not be ready for delivery for some months to come,— at the solicitation of many of our readers we have concluded to commence publishing extracts  from it on or before the commencement of the second series.

[We publish the following “Chapter of Ontario Chronicles” just as it came to us, without pretending to any knowledge of its origin, veracity, or divinity, other than what we gather from the assurance of the gentleman who enclosed it to us, that it is “founded on fact.” Whether we shall publish the succeeding Chapters, will depend entirely on one or two contingences.]THE BITERbit—OR, ANTI-MASONICWIT outwitted.CHAPTER I.It came to pass in the days of J****h the Prophet, and about the fourth reign of Solomonand P***k, that many of the people of Israel waxed wroth one towards another, and were sorely grieved, because of their failure to get themselves into the high places of the Synagogue. Among the multitude that has in vain sought to fatten on the emoluments of office, was a certain Israelite who dwelt near the Temple of Nephi, and who was called by his mother Adolphus.Now Adolphus was a man small of stature, and was withal a worker in wood; howbeit he was somewhat of a depraved mind and lusteth much after the things of this world.Moreover he was exceedingly avaricious, insomuch that he coveted the riches if William, who was a humble man and belonged withal to another tribe.Wherefore Adolphus conceived in his heart that he would make William drunk with wine, that he might betray him, and take unto himself his gold and silver, and also his land and cattle.But the Lord saw and rebuked the wickedness and deceit of Adolphus; nevertheless Adolphus hardened his heart and heeded not the admonition of the Lord.And it moreover came to pass that William was inspired with a knowledge of the deceitfulness of and cunning of Adolphus, and guarded his mind against his evil designs and machinations. Howbeit, Adolphus wist not the wisdom of William.Now the Lord favored William, inasmuch as he was an honest man and lusteth not overmuch after the things of mammon; but Adolphus, the Israelite, he upbraided, for his deeds of darkness and iniquity, and caused a JUDGMENT to be pronounced against him.And Adolphus communed with himself and wept bitterly, saying, wo!

[From the Book of Mormon.]THE FIRST BOOK OF NEPHI.HIS REIGN AND MINISTRY.CHAPTER I.I, Nephi, having been born of goodly parents, therefore I was taught somewhat in all the learning of my father; and having seen many afflictions in the course of my days– nevertheless, having been highly favored of the Lord in all my days; yea, having had a great knowledge of the goodness and the mysteries of God, therefore I make a record of my proceedings in my days; yea, I make a record in the language of my father, which consists of the learning of the Jews and the language of the Egyptians. And I know that the record which I make, to be true; and I make it with mine own hand; and I make it according to my knowledge.For it came to pass, in the commencement of the first year of the reign of Zedekiah, king of Judah, (my father Lehi having dwelt at Jerusalem in all his days;) and in that same year there came many prophets, prophesying unto the people, that they must repent, or the great city Jerusalem must be destroyed. Wherefore it came to pass, that my father Lehi, as he went forth, prayed unto the Lord, yea, even with all his heart, in behalf of his people.And it came to pass, as he prayed unto the Lord, there came a pillar of fire and dwelt upon a rock before him; and he saw and heard much; and because of the things which he saw and heard, he did quake and tremble exceedingly.And it came to pass that he returned to his own house at Jerusalem; and he cast himself upon his bed, being overcome with the spirit and the things which he had seen; and being thus overcome with the spirit, he was carried away in a vision, even that he saw the Heavens open; and he thought he saw God sitting upon his throne, surrounded with numberless concourses of angels in the attitude of singing and praising their God.And it came to pass that he saw one descending out of the midst of Heaven, and he beheld that his lustre was above that to the sun at noon-day; and he also saw twelve others following him, and their brightness did exceed that of the stars of the firmament; and they came down and went forth upon the face of the earth; and the first came and stood before my father, and gave unto him a Book, and bade him that he should read.And it came to pass that as he read, he was filled with the spirit of the Lord, and he read saying, Wo, wo unto Jerusalem! for I have seen thine abominations; yea, and many things did my father read concerning Jerusalem–that it should be destroyed, and the inhabitants thereof, many should perish by the sword, and many should be carried away captive into Babylon.And it came to pass that when my father had read and saw many great and marvellous things, he did exclaim many things unto the Lord; such as, Great and marvellous are thy works, O Lord God Almighty! Thy throne is high in the Heavens, and thy power, and goodness, and mercy is over all the inhabitants of the earth; and because thou art merciful, thou wilt not suffer those who come unto thee that they shall perish! And after this manner was the language of my father in the praising of his God; for his soul did rejoice, and his whole heart was filled, because of the things which he had seen; yea, which the Lord had shewn unto him. And now I, Nephi, do not make a full account of the things which my father hath written, for he hath written many things which he saw in visions and in dreams; and he also hath written many things which he did as the Lord commanded him.(To be Continued)
GOLD BIBLE. We do not intend at this time, to discuss the merits or demerits of this work, and feel astonished that some of our neighbors, who profess liberal principles, and are probably quite as ignorant on the subject as we are, should give themselves quite so much uneasiness about matters that so little concern them. The Book, when it shall come before the public, must stand or fall according to the whims and fancies of its readers. How it will stand the test of rigid criticism, we are not prepared to say, not having as yet examined many of its pages.—We are, however, prepared to state, that from a part of the first chapter, now before us, and which we this day publish, we cannot discover any thing treasonable, or which will have a tendency to subvert our liberties. As to its religious character, we have as yet no means of determining, and if we had, we should be quite loth to meddle with the tender consciences of our neighbors.
“Gold Bible.”— We inadvertently neglected in our remarks last week, respecting this wonderful work, to accompany them with the explanations requisite to, correct understanding of it. The appellation of “Gold Bible,” is only a cant cognomen that has been given it by the unbelievers—for be it known that this Book, as well as the sacred volume which is held so valuable by all good christians, is not without its revilers and unbelievers—by way of derision. The true title of the work, as appears from the copy-right, is “The Book of Mormon,”—comprising a great number of Books, or parts, by different primary authors, all of which are divided into Chapters. The first is “First Book of Nephi,” of which we gave an extract in our last, and is continued in the present number of our paper. The whole purports to be a compilation, in ancient hierogliphics, on plates said to resemble plates of gold, by one of the chosen of the lost tribes, whose name was MORMON.
[From the “Book of Mormon,” erroneously calledthe “Gold Bible.”]THE FIRST BOOK OF NEPHI.HIS REIGN AND MINISTRY.CHAPTER I.(Continued from our last.)And it came to pass that he departed into the wilderness. And he left his house, and the land of his inheritance, and his gold, and his silver, and his precious things, and took nothing with him save it were his family, and provisions, and tents, and he departed into the wilderness; and he came down by the borders near the shore of the Red Sea; and he travelled in the wilderness, on the borders, which was nearer the Red Sea; and he did travel in the wilderness with his family, which consisted of my mother, Sarah, and my elder brothers, which were Laman, Lemuel and Sam.And it came to pass that when he had travelled three days in the wilderness, he pitched his tent in a valley beside a river of water; And it came to pass that he built an altar of stones, and he made an offering unto the Lord, and gave thanks unto the Lord our God. And it came to pass that he called the name of the river Laman, and it emtied into the Red Sea; and the valley was on the borders near the mouth thereof.And when my father saw that the waters of the river emptied into the fountain of the Red Sea, he spake unto Laman, saying: O that though mightest be like unto this river, continuallyrunning into the fountain of all righteousness. And he also spake unto Lemuel: O that thou mightest be like unto ths valley, firm, and steadfast, and immoveable in keeping the commandments of the Lord. Now this he spake because of the stiffneckedness of Laman and Lemuel; for behold, they did murmur in many things against their father, because that he was a visionary man, and that he had led them out of the land of Jerusalem, to leave the land of their inheritance, and their gold, and their silver, and their precious things, and to perish in the wilderness. And this they said he had done because of the foolish imaginations of his heart. And thus Laman and Lemuel, being the eldest, did murmur against their father. And they did murmur because they knew not the dealings of that God who had created them. Neither did they believe that Jerusalem, that great city, could be destroyed according to the words of the prophets. And they were like unto the Jews, which were at Jerusalem, which sought to take away the life of my father.And it came to pass that my father did speak unto them in the valley of Lemuel, with power, being filled with the spirit, until their frames did shake before him. And he did confound them, that they durst not utter against him; wherefore they did do as he commanded them. And my father dwelt in a tent. (To be Continued.)
[Extract from the BOOK of ALMA, CHAPTER XX.] Behold, now it came to pass, that they durst not come against the Nephites in the borders of Jershon; therefore they departed out of the land of Antionum, into the wilderness, and took their journey round about in the wilderness, away by the head of the river Sidon, that they might come into the land of Manti, and take possession of the land; for they did not suppose that the armies of Moroni would know whither they had gone. But it came to pass, as soon as they had departed into the wilderness, Moroni sent spies into the wilderness, to watch their camp; and Moroni, also, knowing of the prophecies of Alma, sent certain men unto him, desiring him that he should inquire of the Lord whither the armies of the Nephites should go, to defend themselves against the Lamanites. And it came to pass that the word of the Lord came unto Alma; and Alma informed the messengers of Moroni that the armies of the Lamanites were marching round about in the wilderness, that they might come over into the land of Manti, that they might commence an attack upon the more weak part of the people. And those messengers went and delivered the message unto Moroni.Now Moroni, leaving a part of his army in the land of Jershon, lest by any means, a part of the Lamanites should come into that land and take possession of the city; and Moroni took the remainder part of his army and marched over into the land of Manti. And he caused that all the people in that quarter of the land, should gather themselves together to battle, against the Lamanites, to defend their lands and their country, their rights and their liberties; therefore they were prepared against the time of the coming of the Lamanites. And it came to pass, that Moroni caused that [27] his army should be secreted in the valley which was near the bank of the river Sidon which was on the west of the river Sidon, in the wilderness. And Moroni placed spies round about, that he might know when the camp of the Lamanites should come.And now as Moroni knew the intention of the Lamanites, that it was their intention to destroy their brethren, or to subject them and bring them into bondage, that they might establish a kingdom unto themselves, over all the land; and he also knowing that it was the only desire of the Nephites to preserve their lands and their liberty, and their church, therefore he thought it no sin that he should defend them by stratagem; therefore he found, by his spies, which course the Lamanites were to take. Therefore he divided his army, and brought apart over into the valley, and concealed them on the east, and on the south of the hill Riplah; and the remainder he concealed in the west valley, on the west of the river Sidon, and so down into the borders of the land Manti. And thus having placed his army according to his desire, he was prepared to meet them.And it came to pass that the Lamanites came up on the north of the hill where a part of the army of Moroni was concealed. And it came to pass that as the Lamanites had passed the hill Riplah, and came into the valley, and began to cross the river Sidon, the army which was concealed on the south of the hill, who was led by a man whose name was Lehi; and he led his army forth and encircled the Lamanites about, on the east, in their rear.And it came to pass that the Lamanites, when they saw the Nephites coming upon them in their rear, turned them about, and began to contend with the army of Lehi; and the work of death commenced, on both sides; but it was more dreadful on the part of the Lamanites; for their nakedness was exposed to the heavy blows of the Nephites, with their swords and their cimeters, which brought death almost at every stroke; while on the other hand, there was now and then a man fell among the Nephites, by their swords, and the loss of blood; they being shielded from the more vital parts of the body, or the more vital parts of the body being shielded from the strokes of the Lamanites, by their breast-plates, and their arm-shields, and their head-plates; and thus the Nephites did carry on the work of death among the Lamanites. And it came to pass that the Lamanites became frightened, because of the great destruction among them, even until they began to flee towards the river Sidon. And they were pursued by Lehi and his men, and they were driven by Lehi into the waters of Sidon; and they crossed the waters of Sidon. And Lehi retained his armies upon the bank of the river Sidon, that they should not cross.
Palmyra, March 11th, 1830.O. DOGBERRY, Esq.—DEAR SIR–When the present series of the Reflector is completed, you will please erase my name from your list of subscribers.Yours, &c.LUTHER HOWARD. We have only to regret that this “little lump of anguish,” who measures something more than four feet in his shoes, had not requested an immediate discontinuance, as he is the only person of the same description our list contains. It is from the enlightened, independent, and liberal minded, that we receive and expect support–not from meddlesome, canting, or whining hypocrites–it is not from a man who professes, ostentatiously, to belong to a Calvinistic church–where himself and his family display a profusion of fine clothing–while he privately advocates the “Gold Bible.” This man has an itching to appear in print—he shall be gratified. We have many communications on hand respecting this pious as well as meddling worthy. His Geneva friends will not be forgotten.
We are requested to announce that the “BOOK OF MORMON” will be ready for sale in the course of next week.
A NEW WAY OF RAISING THE WIND. It is frequently remarked, that any scheme, however gross, will find more or less dupes. The accuracy of the saying, is, it seems by the following advertisement from the Wayne Sentinel, to be now tested anew in this region of “excitements.” . . . 
City of Mud, March, 1830 Mr. Reflector–Sir–As you appear to possess some literary acquirements–if not talents–and as you may possibly take it into your head, some day or other, to publish an exclusively literary paper–I have taken the liberty of sending you a recipe for making one up. It is taken from “real life”–has stood the test of the critique, and is doubtless a great step in the common wealth of letters.Imprimis.–Be careful to get a soft head for your paper–so that the sound may be pleasing to a lady’s ear–such as GEM, Boquet, &c.–and be careful to state, in your first page, that you paper is devoted entirely to “Literature and Science,” [106] lest half the old women (of both sexse) should never be able to discover your object.Secondly.–As it is necessary to have in every number, at least one long original, leading, editorial article, the bare thoughts of which, frequently give many of our weak-nerved editors the horrors, you must provide yourself with a good store of romances, written in the fifteenth century, when literary taste was at its zenith; and ranges probably nearer our own times than any other period.In selecting your subject (article) for dissection, let your scene be laid in France, Italy, or the holy land, (this will be more interesting to the unlearned reader,) cut off the head and tail of it, alter the names, and commence from the bottom of the page to copy upwards, in imitation of the translators of the Book of Mormon, or the “Gold Bible.” In this way you give it a cast of originality.In making your extracts or selection, take the flattest articles you can find.–This will give a sort of uniformity to the whole. Insert all the garbled nonsense, in the shape, or under the head of poetry, that you can find, appending the sweet smelling names of “nosegay, posey,” &c. This will have a good effect on the censorium. Publish a long prospectus of some forth-coming periodical, to let “your readers know, that weakness loves company”–a column or two of names, as agents for your paper, (should it be a small one,) will be quite interesting–more especially to the divine sex–and last, but not least, be careful to insert in each paper, through the year, the receipt of from fifty to eighty new subscribers “since out last.” NEWSMONGER.
The Book of Mormon, or what is better known by the title of the Gold Bible, has been recently published at Palmyra.
Mr. Editor— Please advise hyrum smith, and some of his ill-bred associates, not to be quite so impertinent, when decent folks denounce the imposition of the ‘Gold-Bible’ The anathemas of such ignorant wretches, although not feared, are not quite so well relished by some people—Apostles should keep cool.
We are informed that an “honest Attorney” (from compunction we suppose,) is about to abandon his lucrative profession, and enter upon the preaching of the “Gospel according to” ——Jo Smith.
For the Reflector. “When ignorance is bliss‘Tis folly to be wise.” In popping into a corner some few days since, I discovered some four or five respectable (looking) men discussing “the Reflector,” when by chance they blundered upon the article headed “John Faust,” as copied from the Lutheran Magazine. After poring over the subject for some time, quite in doubt as to its true import or meaning, never having (before) heard the story of “the Devil and Doctor Faustus,” at last came to the sage conclusion that “it must be a hit at Jo Smith’s gold bible.”What astonished me the most, was, that men should be found in the neighborhood, and in fact under the droppings of the “Mechanics’ Institute,” and at the same time so profoundly ignorant that they could not discern a shade of difference between a scrap of grave history, and a burlesque upon one of the most ridiculous attempts at imposture ever witnessed since the days of Sabatai Sevi.I would recommend the organization of a “march-of-intellect-society,” for the instruction of elderly gentlemen, whose education has been neglected, with a course of reading adapted to their capacity. A.
The apostle to the NEPHITES (Cowdery) has started for the East, on board a boat, with a load of ‘gOld bibles,’ under a command, (as he says) to declare the truth (according to Jo Smith,) ‘in all the principal cities in the Union.’ We must, however, caution this second Mahomet (Jemima Wilkinson,) to be careful how he treads upon the Old Saybrook Platform. Oliver (he left out his two middle names in the “Book of Mormon,) may find his way to the Simsbury mines.
A fellow by the name of Joseph Smith, who resides in the upper part of Susquehanna county, has been, for the last two years we are told, employed in dedicating as he says, by inspiration, a new bible. He pretended that he had been entrusted by God with a golden bible which had been always hidden from the world. Smith would put his face into a hat in which he had a white stone, and pretend to read from it, while his coadjutor transcribed. The book purports to give an account of the “Ten Tribes,” and strange as it may seem, there are some who have full faith in his Divine commission. The book it seems is now published. We extract the following from the Rochester Republican. Wayne Co. Inq.BLASPHEMY.—“Book of Mormon” alias The Golden Bible.—The “Book of Mormon” has been placed in our hands. A viler imposition was never practised. It is an evidence of fraud, blasphemy, and credulity, shocking to the Christian and moralist. The “author and proprietor is one Joseph Smith, Jr,” a fellow who, by some hocus pocus, acquired such an influence over a farmer of Wayne county, that the latter mortgaged his farm for $3,000 which he paid for printing and binding 5000 copies of this blasphemous work. The volume consists of about 600 pages, and is divided into the books of Nephi, of Jacob, of Mosiah, of Alma, of Mormon, of Ether, and of Helaman. “Copy right secured.”
Our citizens were considerably agitated on the morning of the 19th inst. by the strangeappearance of a strange animal, whose manner was very little different from that of the famous Lorenzo Dow–who introduced himself to the notice of a gazing multitude, by raising his stentorian voice to a surprising height, and continued pouring forth his melody, until driven from his station by the rains of heaven (which were not very congenial to the bristly cranium of the itinerant) falling upon his uncovered head in torrents–and thus warning him to “flee from the wrath to come”–whereupon he ‘took up his’ sack ’and walked,’ declaring his command to “preach the gospel to every creature” (at the methodist ‘meetin house’) and to ‘all the earth, in the highways, and on the house tops.’–We know not whether he is a follower of Jemima Wilkinson, Jo Smith, jun. or the devil–We are however, credibly informed that at a disorderly meeting on Sunday evening at the M A R K E T one of Jo'sgreatest apostles, gave decided tokens of entire approbation. . . .It has been reported that one of the “Gold Bible” witnesses has been in the habit of whipping and otherwise mal-treating his wife for the sole purpose of making her a proselyte to the faith according to Joe Smith. [45] . . .We have been informed that a “Gold Bible” apostle lately undertook to anathematise an infidel.!!!
A hungry lean-faced villain,A mere anatomy, a mountebank,A thread-bare juggler and a fortune-teller;A needy, hollow-eyed, sharp-looking wretch,A living dead man; this pernicious slave,Forsooth took on him as a conjurer;And gazing in mine eyes, feeling my pulse,And with no face, as it were out-facing me,Cries out, I was possessed.—Shakespeare.The age of miracles has again arrived, and if the least reliance can be placed upon the assertions, daily made by the “Gold Bible” apostles, (which is somewhat doubtful,) no prophet since the destruction of Jerusalem by Titus, has performed half so many wonders as have been attributed to that spindle shanked ignoramus Jo Smith. This fellow appears to possess the quint essence of impudence, while his fellow laborers are not far behind him in this particular–they go from place to place disturbing in a greater or less degree, the peace of the community–denouncing dire damnation on such as may with hold their approbation from one of the most ridiculous impostures, ever promulgated.Jo'sgreatest as well as latest miracle, as narrated by St. Martin, is his “casting out of a devil,” of an uncommon size from a miserable man in the neighborhood of the “great bend” of the Susquehannah. The whole family of spirits, who are said to have possessed the fair Magdalene, were mere children, when compared to the imp in question. Such was his malignant disposition that before Jo took him in hand, he had nigh demolished the frail tenement which had for a long time afforded him a comfortable shelter– the flesh was “about to cleave from the bones”–the muscles, tendons, &c. could no longer perform their different functions–the habitation of Satan, was about to be laid open to the light of day, when the prophet interfered–went to prayer–the demoniac had faith–the devil was routed, and nature resumed her accustomed order.
Exemption from taxation.—A disciple of the “Gold Bible,” lately called on an assessor and demanded an exemption from taxation, to the amount of $1500–alledging that he was a Minister of the Gospel, at the same time producing a certificate, signed by Jo. Smith, and Oliver Cowdery, by way of proof–the course to be taken in this matter has not yet transpired.
BOOK OF DANIEL [From Lyons.] Now it came to pass, in the 52nd and 53d years of American Independence, and during the reign of the prophet Joseph, there resided not a day’s ride east of the tabernacle of St. Martin, a certain (would be) great man, whose sir-name was Daniel–who was a man of great self-respect, and whose profession was that of administering aid to the afflicted in body-who found reception and audience amongst Jerseyans and Alleganians. . . .

And now be it known unto you, all ye of the “precious knowledge of Mormon,” that these are true, even as that some of these things happened after his stay at the house of Tobias.

The Palmyra Sentinel makes high pretensions to purity. It professes to have a great aversion to all kinds of disrespectful publications; and feigns to be one of the most immaculate journals of the day! But in order to show its hypocrisy, it is necessary only to state, that. “The Reflector,” a sarcastical, obscene little paper, the character of which is so well known in this quarter, that comment from us, respecting it, would be useless, is issued weekly from that office; as also was the infamous, catch-penny work, entitled the “Book of Mormon,” or, as it is generally called, the “Golden Bible.” These two publications have cast a lasting reproach upon the Sentinel–a reproach which years of penance would not wipe away. This is all right; for when a printer becomes so abandoned, and lost to all sense of decency, as to allow such nuisances to be published in his office, he should be branded with infamy and disgrace. Public indignation cannot be wrought to too high a degree against such a printer. He should be pointed out to the world as an object of scorn and contempt. And this is the case with the printer of the Sentinel and his coadjutors.The Sentinel is controlled by a few unprincipled masonic demagogues of Palmyra; and has become prostituted to their base purposes. It is filled weekly with a tirade of abuse and insult against all who have too much regard for their reputation, to join the crusade which these individuals have commenced. Their names do not appear as editors of that paper; and they therefore imagine that they can indulge in scurrility and abuse without being generally known to the public. Like the institution they support, they “strike the blow, but conceal the hand.”We have no inclination to check the mad career of the conductors of the Sentinel. We are perfectly willing that they should revel in their abominations. They can be of no possible injury to anti-masonry; nor advantage to free-masonry. So, gentlemen, push on with your un-envied task defamation–you shall meet with no opposition at our hand!
Nothing is further from our intentions, than the idea of controlling or interfering with the tender consciences of our neighbors in matters of religious import, provided there is even the appearance of sincerity; and even that gross and bungling imposition the “gold bible,” would have passed unnoticed, had it not been necessary to expose the hypocricy and cant of its pretended apostles. We are the decided advocates of civil and religious liberty, and where superstition itself can be considered (if ever it can) harmless, we shall not interfere,; but when a cloak of religion, aided by a long beard is made use of for the vilest of purposes, and where a pretended messenger of heaven principly exerts his influence, on the superstitious and ignorant, for the sole purpose of seducing them from the path of virtue, it is time the wretch was unmasked and his hideous form exhibited for the inspection of an indignant public. If in an investigation which we intend to set on fooot at some future period, we shall introduce some of the monks, females co-workers in lasciviousness (we mean the nuns,) we [124] hope no half literary poppinjay will accuse us of being inimical to the cause of virtue.
Some two or three years since, an account was given in the papers, of a book purporting to contain new revelations from Heaven, having been dug out of the ground, in Manchester in Ontario Co. N.Y. The book, it seems, has made its appearance in this vicinity.–It contains about 600 octavo pages, which is said to be translated from Egyptian Hieroglyphics, on metal plates, by one Smith, who was enabled to read the characters by instruction from Angels. About two weeks since some persons came along here with the book, one of whom pretends to have seen Angels, and assisted in translating the plates. He proclaims destruction upon the world within a few years,–holds forth that the ordinances of the gospel, have not been regularly administered since the days of the Apostles, till the said Smith and himself commenced the work–and many other marvellous things too numerous to mention. In the neighboring township of Kirtland, we understand that twenty or thirty have been immersed into the new order of things; many of whom had been previously baptised.–The name of the person here, who pretends to have a divine mission, and to have seen and conversed with Angels, is Cowdray. We understand that he is bound for the regions beyond the Mississippi, where he contemplates founding a “City of Refuge” for his followers, and converting the Indians, under his prophetic authority.
THE GOLDEN BIBLE, or, Campbellism Improved. Mr. Isham. — For several days past, four individuals, said to have formerly resided in the State of New-York, have appeared in the northern part of Geauga County, assuming the appellation of Disciples, Prophets, and Angels. Some among us, however, are led to believe that they are nothing more than men, and impostors. They are preaching and teaching a species of Religion we are not all prepared to embrace; for we are convinced it does not accord with our old-fashioned Bible. These men have brought with them copies of a Book, known in this region by the name of the "Golden Bible," or, as it is learned on its title-page, "The Book of Mormon." They solemnly affirm, that its contents were given by Divine inspiration; was written by prophets of the Most High from a period of 600 years before, to that of some hundred years after our blessed Saviour's advent; was deposited by Divine command below the surface of the ground, in or near the township of Palmyra, Ontario Co. N. Y.; that an Angel appeared to a certain Joseph Smith residing in that place, who, they say, was a poor, ignorant, illiterate man, and made no pretensions to religion of any kind;—[original text illegible] . . . of this sacred deposit, and directed him forthwith to dig up and bring to light this precious record and prophecy. They affirm that the said Smith obeyed the heavenly messenger, when lo! a new Revelation—the Golden Bible was discovered! According to the narrative given by one of these disciples—Oliver Cowdery—at their late exhibition in Kirtland, this pretended Revelation was written on golden plates, or something resembling golden plates, of the thickness of tin—7 inches in length, 6 inches in breadth, and a pile about 6 inches deep. None among the most learned in the United States could read, and interpret the hand-writing, (save one, and he could decipher but a few lines correctly,) excepting this ignoramus, Joseph Smith, Jr. To him, they say, was given the spirit of interpretation; but he was ignorant of the art of writing, he employed this Oliver Cowdery and others to write, while he read, interpreted, and translated this mighty Revelation. It appears from the testimony of these men, that while this process was going on, some of their mischievous, meddlesome neighbors, having a miserly disposition, stole some of their plates of gold before they gave them sufficient time to translate them, and as they have not yet been recovered, they fear a part of this great Revelation will be lost to our race. There were other plates among them, they say, which contained secrets which are not yet to be revealed. These escaped from them by some mysterious dispensation of Providence, they know not how, or in what region they are secreted, but as they are to be forthcoming at the proper time, to some future generation, they appear to manifest no particular uneasiness with regard to them. To convince the world that this record and prophecy is a Divine Revelation, three men, Oliver Cowdery, David Whitmer and Martin Harris, have subscribed their names to an article in this "Book of Mormon," solemnly declaring that they saw an Angel come down from heaven, who showed them those plates, and made known to them it was given by inspiration, and "they know of a surety it is true," &c. &c. This new Revelation, they say is especially designed for the benefit, or rather for the christianizing of the Aborigines of America; who, as they affirm, are a part of the tribe of Manasseh, and whose ancestors landed on the coast of Chili 600 years before the coming of Christ, and from them descended all the Indians of America. You are, perhaps, by this time ready to say, Surely this great hue and cry about a book of this character, in unworthy of public notice; none possessed of the holy Scriptures, will be found so weak as to be led to embrace this delusion. But sir, could you but see the multitude that follow those pretended Disciples, and know the number they have baptized each night, (many of whom 'tis said have now been immersed for the third time;) were you to be informed, that a certain Elder hesitated in deciding whether to reject or receive the new Revelation, and that the "social Union," or as it is more familiarly called in its vicinity, the "common stock family," have gone into the water again in token of embracing it; and consider that their great object in bending their way to the West is to convert the Indians to the new faith, among many of whose tribes Christian Missionaries are faithfully, and through the blessing of God, successfully laboring,—I say in view of this—in view of the worth of souls, liable to be deluded and lost, will you not as a Herald of the Cross of Christ, raise the note of alarm, in your widely circulating paper? I take the liberty of sending you a Chapter in the new Bible. Though it be called a new Revelation, you will perceive, whoever the author may have been, that it is the same that is held forth by a certain denomination which has sprung up in our day. It is maintained that this is not a new Gospel, but that it explains the New Testament.  Yours, &c.  A. S. 2d. Book of Nephi, Chap. 12th.And now, I, Nephi, make an end of my prophesying unto you, my beloved brethren. And I cannot write but a few things which I know must surely come to pass, neither can I write but a few words of my brother Jacob. Wherefore, the things which I have written, sufficeth me, save it be a few words concerning the doctrine of Christ; wherefore, I shall speak unto you plainly, according to the plainness of my prophesying. For my soul delighteth in plainness: for after this manner doth the Lord God work among the children of men. For the Lord God giveth light unto the understanding: for he speaketh to their language, unto their understanding. Wherefore, I would that ye should remember that I have spoken unto you, concerning that prophet which the Lord showed unto me, that should baptize the Lamb of God, which should take away the sins of the world. And now, if the Lamb of God, he being holy, should have need to be baptized by water, to fulfil all righteousness, O then, how much more need have we, being unholy, to be baptized, yea, even by water.And now I would ask of you, my beloved brethren, wherein the Lamb of God did fulfil all righteousness in being baptized by water? Know ye not that he was holy? But notwithstanding he being holy, he showeth unto the children of men, that according to the flesh he humbleth himself before the Father, and witnesseth unto the Father that he would be obedient unto him in keeping the commandments; wherefore after that he was baptized with water, the holy Ghost descended upon him in the form of a dove. And again: it sheweth unto the children of men the straitness of the path and the narrowness of the gate, by which they should enter, he hath set the example before them. And he saith unto the children of men, Follow thou me. Wherefore, my beloved brethren, can we follow Jesus, save we shall be willing to keep the commandments of the Father? And the Father saith, Repent ye, repent ye, and be baptized in the name of my beloved Son. And also, the voice of the Son came unto me saying, He that is baptized in my name, to him will the Father give the Holy Ghost, like unto me; wherefore, follow me, and do the things which ye have seen me do. Wherefore, my beloved brethren, I know that if ye shall follow the Son, with full purpose of heart, acting no hypocrisy and no deception before God, but with real intent, repenting of your sins, witnessing unto the Father that ye are willing to take upon you the name of Christ, by baptism; yea, by following your Lord and Saviour down into the water, according to his word; behold, then shall ye receive the Holy Ghost; yea, then cometh the baptism of fire and of the Holy Ghost; and then can ye speak with the tongues of Angels, and shout praises unto the Holy One of Israel. * * *—and after this, should you deny me, it would have been better if ye had not known me. * * * —for the gate by which ye should enter, is repentance, and baptism by water, and then cometh a remission of your sins by fire, and the Holy Ghost. And then are ye in this strait and narrow path —yea, ye have entered in by the Gate. 
We should be slow to believe that any set of men would accept to play off upon the community, so barefaced a deception as that which our correspondent speaks; and equally slow to believe, that any could be found so credulous as to be duped and led astray by it,—did we not know, that men are the same depraved beings that ever they were; did we not know, that it is a crime which Heaven has laid to the charge of our fallen race, that they “seek out many inventions”—that “they go astray as soon as they be born speaking lies.” While unruly passion sways the empire of the heart, and guilt draws its film over the moral vision, and a cloud of ignorance darkens the intellect, it would be strange if men should go straight forward in the narrow path. It would be strange if, in their bewilderment, they did not listen to the cry, “lo here, and lo there.” So it has been in all ages of the world—and so it will continue to be, until the minds of men are enlightened, and their hearts warmed by the rays of the Sun of Righteousness. Since commencing this article, we have received information, which goes to corroborate the statements made in the communication of our correspondent, and also furnishes several additional particulars. The Elder referred to, is the famous Campbellite leader, who has made so much noise on the Reserve for a few months past. He has finally concluded to receive the new Revelation, and has actually been baptized, (now for the third time.) “The common stock family” mentioned in the communication, is a club of Campbellites, who have all things common. It is said that they hold their meetings till late at night, and afterwards retire to the river, and baptize by the score. They profess to have the power of working miracles. Having given out that they would perform a miraculous cure upon a person who was sick, an assembly collected to witness the experiment, when lo, there was a want of faith, and until this difficulty could be removed, the miracles must remain unwrought;—the old lady continues sick to this day. They are now on their way to the Western Indians, for whose benefit the new Revelation was especially designed. The Indians, as fast as they are converted are to become white men. This is one of the absurdities which have been broached, and we see in it the finger of an overruling Providence. The sagacious Indian, when he sees, that in spite of their incantations, he is an Indian still, will not suffer himself to be any further befooled. 
COMMUNICATION. Mr. Editor,—I have gotten some additional information respecting the Book of Mormon, which I send you for insertion in your paper, if you see fit. It is contained in an extract, which I have just taken from a letter, written from a town in the State of New York, where, as I had been previously told, this Jos. Smith has resided some years, and from which he set out, with an attendant, in pursuit of the gold plates,.which he found, as they say, about one hundred and fifty miles from the place of starting. The letter is dated Oct. 18th, 1830, and the extract is as follows:“You have probably heard of the Gold Bible taken from the earth by Joseph Smith, the money-digger. This he has translated from the Egyptian reformed language to English, by a pair of stone spectacles (provided by an angel) and a dark hat before his eyes. The books have been printed, and J. S. and Mr. N—s are engaged in peddling the same. The society are increasing. Eighteen have been baptized in a day. H. P. and wife have been baptized, & are very strong in the faith. The girls are under conviction. The leaders pretend to cast out devils and work miracles, heal the sick, &c. We have seen none of their miracles here, except N. N. I heard say in meeting, that he had had the devil cast out.”I just add, that I have been almost in contact with these peddlers in different parts of this county, having my information from them only through most credible second hand informers, who state that they said, they knew the book, and the manner in which it is said to have been found, was true; or that they did not believe it, but knew it. They are said to be respectable men. The wife of one of them, though immersed formerly by an Elder in this county, has been immersed or baptized again into this new system. I only state facts, and leave the judicious and pious to their own reflections.CLERICUS.P. S. There was a little error in the former piece. You mistook my L for an S in the word Lamanites.
“The Golden Bible.”— Yes, reader strange as it may appear, there is a new Bible just published, entitled the “Book of Mormon,” and better known to some as the Golden Bible. We have no doubt many will be shocked to learn there are those sacriligious enough to contend that a new bible has been given to the children of men. But it is even so, for we have lately purchased one for the gratification of our curiosity, which was rather excited on learning that its doctrines were taught and believed in this and the adjoining counties.We have not read it in course, but have perused it sufficiently to be convinced it is one of the veriest impositions of the day. . . . The Bible is composed of, first and second Book of Nephi; Book of Jacob; Book of Joram; Book of Mormon; Book of Moriah; Book of Alma; Book of Helaman; Book of Nephi, the son of Helaman; Book of Nephi, the son of Nephi; Book of Mormon; Book of Ether and Book of Moroni.The last book appears to have been added as a sort of appendix, and contains the form of se vice, mode of eneciation, prayers, &c.This bible is closed by two certificates commending the work: to the first is attached the name of Oliver Cowdry and two other persons, and to the last are eight names, among which are those of the father and two brothers of the reputed author.On reading the name of Oliver Cowdry, in support of the divine authenticity of the work, whatever faith we might have been inspired with on reading the certificate, was banished, for we had known Cowdry some seven or eight years ago, when he was a dabbler in the art of Printing, and principally occupied in writing and printing pamphlets, with which, as a pedestrian Pedlar he visited the towns and villages of western New-York and Canada, and the only opinion we have of the origin of this Golden Bible is, that Mr. Cowdry and Mr. Smith the reputed author, have taken the old Bible to keep up a train of circumstances, and by altering names and language have produced the string of Jargon called the “Book of Mormon,” with the intention of making mony by the sale of their Books; and being aware that they would not sell unless an excitement and curiosity could be raised in the public mind, have therefore sent out twelve Apostles to promulgate its doctrines, several of whom are in this vicinity expounding its mysteries [sic] and baptising converts to its principles, whose labors, we understand are principally blest among the superstitious and ignorant or hypocritical, presenting a new proof that all fools are not dead, and knavery in any garb may, yet find votaries.
The Book of Mormon— It being the business of an Editor to collect and lay before his readers, whatever seems to agitate the public mind, we took occasion two weeks ago to notice a pretended new revelation from God, which had recently visited this vicinity. To record the thousand tales which are in circulation respecting the book and its propogators, would be an endless task, and probably lead to the promulgation of a hundred times more than was founded in truth. In this way, we perceive that the Gazette last week, shot wide of the mark in many important particulars. There are rising of 100 in this and an adjoining county who have embraced the ideas and assertions of Joseph Smith, jr. many of them respectable for intelligence and piety. If the book of Mormon, as it is called, with the pretentions of its apostles, is a fabrication, it is one of the most infamous and blasphemous character; and we must confess, after having an opportunity to canvass some of its claims to a true revelation from God, we have not been able to discover testimony which ought to elicit faith in any prudent or intelligent mind. It may, perhaps, be useless to condemn the thing by positive and absolute assertions—time will discover in it either something of vast importance to men, or a deep laid plan to deceive many.The four persons who were here, have proceeded on their mission to the Indians, (or Lamanites, as they term them) in the “far west,” where they say a Prophet is to be raised up, in whom the tribes will believe.As but few have had the opportunity of seeing the Book, we extract the following from the title page: . . . The book closes with the certificate of 11 persons, who have seen the plates and many other marvellous things; among whom are the father and other relatives of the author.
THE GOLDEN BIBLE. In the Fall of 1827, a man named Joseph Smith of Manchester, Ontario county, N.Y. reported that he had three times been visited in a dream, by the spirit of the Almighty, and informed that in a certain hill in that town, was a Golden Bible, containing an ancient record of a divine nature and origin. On going to the spot he found buried the Bible with a huge pair of spectacles: The leaves (he said, tho' he was not permitted to shew them) were plates of gold, about 8 inches long, 6 wide, and 1-8th of an inch thick, on which were engraved characters or hieroglyphicks, which with the spectacles he could interpret. Martin Harris an industrious farmer, caught the contagion, took some of the characters to different learned men to translate, but without success. He returned, set Smith to work at translating it, and has had it printed.About two weeks since, Oliver Cowdry, David Whitmer, and Martin Harris, arrived at Painesville Ohio, with the Books. In the evening they preached in the Methodist Chapel, claiming to act under a commission written by the finger of God. They appear very enthusiastic, and predict the end of the world in 15 years, when all but true believers will be destroyed. They then proceeded to Kirtland, where they held forth, and elder Rigdon, formerly a baptist, and latterly a Campbellite, joined them, as did several of his congregation, and were baptized. The three men above named have now gone west of the Mississippi, where they say is a holy spot, and there they are to establish a New Jerusalem, into which will be gathered all the Natives who they say are descendants of Manasseh. They say they are led by the spirit and will know the ground when they place their feet on it.The book is entitled “The Book of Mormon: An account written by the hand of Mormon, upon plates taken from the plates of Nephi.” It contains the 1st and 2d book of Nephi; book of Jacob; of Joram; of Mormon; of Moriah; of Alma; of Helama; of Nephi, the son of Helaman; of Nephi the son of Nephi; of Ether; and book of Moroni, the last contains the form of service, mode of initiation, prayers &c. It is, doubtless, one of the veriest impositions of the present day.
The manner in which one of the “GOLD BIBLE” witnesses treats his wife, and how he uses “weighty arguments,” to bring her over to the faith according to JO SMITH, has come to hand, but as we understand a legal investigation may hereafter take place, we shall lay the article on the shelf for the present. In the interim however, we feel bound to give it as our humble opinion, that a man who will maltreat the wife of his bosom, under such circumstances, should be driven from the society of MEN.
For the Telegraph. THE BOOK OF MORMON. Those who are the friends and advocates of this wonderful book, state that Mr. Oliver Cowdry has his commission directly from the God of Heaven, and that he has credentials, written and signed by the hand of Jesus Christ, with whom he has personally conversed, and as such, said Cowdry claims that he and his associates are the only persons on earth who are qualified to administer in his name. By this authority, they proclaim to the world, that all who do not believe their testimony, and be baptized by them for the remission of sins, and come under the imposition of their hands for the gift of the Holy Ghost, and stand in readiness to go to some unknown region, where God will provide a place of refuge for his people, called the “New Jerusalem,” must be forever miserable, let their life have been what it may. If these things are true, God has certainly changed his order of commission. When Jesus sent his disciples to preach, he gave them power against all unclean spirits, to cast them out, to heal all manner of diseases, and to raise the dead. But these newly commissioned disciples have totally failed thus far in their attempts to heal, and as far as can be ascertained, their prophecys have also failed. Jesus Christ has forewarned us not to believe them: “There shall arise false Christs and false Prophets, and shall show great signs and wonders, insomuch if it were possible they shall deceive the very elect—behold I have told you before, we give too much credit to these men”—Let us follow the example of the church at Ephesus. “Thou hast tried them which say they are Apostles, and are not, and hast found them liars.” “We ought to believe God, though it should prove all men to be liars.” A lover of Truth
The New Bible. – Some year or two since the crdulous were amused with the tale that, guided by inspiration, some one had found many golden plates buried in the earth near Palmyra, Wayne county, in this state, upon which were revealed,in an unknown tongue, (an odd sort of revelation one would think) the whole duty of man. This the finder and comrade were enabled, by supernatural agency, to translate since which the book has been printed and travelling preachers have gone forth with it, to enlighten the world. Some of these have rested for a season in the vicinity of Painesville, Ohio, where a preacher of another faith was converted to the new, and a band of followers, amounting to more than one hundred, added to his train. It is the theory of some Philosophers that man is a religious animal, and the position seems well sustained here, where a new creed is deemed necessary to be added to the hundreds of all forms which existed before. — Buffalo Journal.
FANATICS. — Oliver Cowdry, David whitmer and Martin Harris, have lately commenced preaching near Painesville, Ohio, stating that they had a new revelation which they call a codicil to the New Testament, and ever to have been written by the finger of God. They say that the world is to come to an end within 15 years: that is the incorrigible are all to be cut off. They have joined one Elder Rigdon, once a Baptist, next a Campbelite, and now a disciple of the new revelation. He and part of his flock, about 100, have been baptized in it, and are going or have gone west for a country, they know not where, west of the Mississippi, where they say is a Holy Spirit, and there they are to establish a New Jerusalem, into which will be gathered all the natives, who they say are descendants of Manasseh. They are led by the spirit and will know the ground when they place their feet upon it. 
We copy the following from the Milan (Huron County) Free Press, promising at the same time, if the statements therein contained should prove erroneous, to publish it freely. We know the sensitiveness of a great number of individuals in this section, on every thing that may be said touching the new Bible and its propogators, many of whom view it as a sin against the Holy Ghost to say aught against Joseph Smith or his apostles.Mr. Jenkins,By publishing the following, you will I presume serve the cause of morality and religion.BEWARE OF IMPOSTORSFour men are travelling westward, who say they are commanded by their Heavenly Father, to go and collect the scattered tribes of Israel, which they say a new Gospel or Prophecy informs them are the different tribes of Indians.This new Gospel they say was found in Ontario co. N.Y. and was discovered by an Angel of light, appearing in a dream to a man by the name of Smith, who, as directed, went to a certain place and dug from the earth a stone box, containing plates of gold, on which this gospel was engraved in characters unknown. The said Smith though a man so illiterate that he cannot write, was, by divine inspiration, enabled to give the true interpretation, and the man who wrote from the mouth of Smith, is one of the four mentioned above.One of the four, by the name of Parly P. Pratt has been a resident of the township of Russia, Lorain co. Ohio, for three or four years last past, until August last, when he was authorised to preach by the sect called Rigdonites, in this vicinity. The next day after receiving this eldership, he ran away from a constable, and numerous creditors, and made his way to Canaan, Columbia county, N.Y. Not being able to gain any proselytes (one young brother of his excepted), he lays his course up the Erie canal as far as Palmyra, where he finds this new Bible, and the men that are with him. It was rumored that said Pratt was expected through this place, and an officer was kept ready to arrest him for debt. He was accordingly arrested, tried, and judgment rendered  against him: and at the same time an execution served on him for cost, on suits tried before he fled to the east. Said Pratt in July last, sold property belonging to one of his neighbors to the amount of several dollars. This neighbor hearing he was in this place, came to see him while he was under the officer's care, and requested a settlement. He, Pratt, refused to do any thing about it “unless his Heavenly Father directed him,”–(these were his words.) After waiting a suitable time, he was told if he did not settle the business, he would be taken with a State warrant. He still refused and a warrant was issued; but before it could be given to the officer, he had, by falsifying his word, escaped from the Constable and fled to the woods, and is now at large, to deceive and lead silly women & more silly men astray.The writer of this had some conversation with Pratt, respecting his belief. He said distinctly, that he had seen visible effects of the descending of the Holy Ghost, upon persons whom he had baptized. I enquired in what he had seen these effects, he replied, “in the same way we read of in the Gospel.” He said he knew, for his Heavenly Father had told him, that when they got among the scattered tribes, there would be as great miracles wrought, as there was at the day of Pentecost.This and much more equally absurd, was advanced by these deluded mortals, and can and will, if required, be attested by at least twelve substantial witnesses. Amherst, Lorain county, Ohio, Nov. 26, 1830.
The following must be considered as one of the many absurdities that rise from the private interpretation of the Scriptures—The principle of a mock reformation, which has unfortunately for the “One Faith,” and the “One Fold” of Christ, created, more ring-leaders, than there are gods to the Pagan Mythology.From the Painsville, Ohio, GazetteDELUSIONAbout a couple of weeks since, three men, calling themselves Oliver Cowdry, David Whitmer, and Martin Harris, appeared in our village, laden with a new revelation, which they claim to be a condict to the New Testament. They preached in the evening in the Methodist Chapel, and from certain indications, conceiving they might do more good elsewhere, departed for Kirtland, where is a “common stock family,” under the charge of Elder Rigdon, a Cambelite leader of some notoriety. The men claim to act under a “commission written by the finger of God”-they are very enthusiastic, tolerably resolute—but from what we can learn need that steadfast determined resolution and popular talent which are necessary to secure any considerable degree of success in a new project. The account which they give is substantially as follows:—At a recent period, an angel appeared to a  poor ignorant man residing in, or near Palmyra, in Ontario county, in the State of New-York, and directed him to open the earth at a place designated, where he would find the new revelation engraved on plates of metal. In obedience to the celestial messenger, Smith repaired to the spot, and on opening the ground, discovered an oblong stone box, tightly closed with cement. He opened the sacred depository, and found enclosed a bundle of plates resembling gold, carefully united at one edge with three silver wires, so that they opened like a book. The plates were about seven inches long and six broad, and the whole pile was about seven inches long and six broad, and was about six inches deep; each plate about the thickness of tin. They were engraved in a character unintelligible to the learned men of the United States, to many of whom it is said they have been presented. The angel afterwards appeared to the three individuals, and showed them the plates. To Smith was given to transcribe the character which he was enabled to do by looking through two semi-transparent stones, but as he was ignorant of the writing, Cowdry and others wrote as Smith interpreted. They say, that part of the plates escaped from them in a supernatural manner, and are again to be revealed when the events of time shall require them.The three individuals above named, have subscribed their names to an article in the book, in which they solemnly declare, that they saw an angel, and that he assured them that the book was a divine revelation. They say it was written by the prophets of God during the period embracing the time of 600 years before, and several hundred after, the Christian era. It predicts, we understand, almost all events which have come to pass, such as the American Revolution, &c.These men are believed by their followers to be prophets—and they say that the world is soon to come to an end—within fifteen years at longest.By the word coming to an end, they only mean that the incorrigible will be cut off by a variety of means, leaving only the true believers. They have now gone west for a country they know not where, west of the Mississippi, where they say is the Holy Spot, and there they are to establish a new Jerusalem, into which they say will be gathered all the natives, who they say are the descendants of Manasseth. They are led by the spirit, and will know the ground when they place their feet on it.Immediately after their arrival here, Elder Rigdon embraced the new doctrine, and was baptized for the third time—once, as a regular Baptist—once, as a Campbelite—and now, as a disciple of the new revelation!  He says he has hitherto, ignorantly, preached heresy. His flock, we understand, have principally followed their shepherd, and some for the third time, have gone down into the water. We are told that the number baptized into the new order, is upwards of one hundred. 
THE BOOK OF GOLD.The following history of a new religion, founded on a book said to have been found in the manner described below, is taken from the Auburn Free Press:“Most of our readers have probably heard of the Golden Bible, which it is asserted was found not long since, in some part of Ontario county. Some of the circumstances attending the remarkable discovery of this truly remarkable work, may not be uninteresting to some of our readers, as they serve to show how easily ignorance and superstition are made to support whatever doctrines may be advanced—no matter how revolting they may appear in the light of reason. An angel appeared to an ignorant man near Palmyra, and directed him to dig at a designated place, with a promise that he would there find a new revelation engraved on plates of metal. The man obeyed the messenger, and on digging, soon discovered an oblong box tightly cemented together. Upon opening this, he found enclosed a bundle of plates similar to gold, about 7 inches long, 6 broad, and in all about 6 inches deep, each sheet being of about the thickness of tin. They were united, at one edge with 3 silver wires, so that they opened in a manner similar to a book. “They were engraven in a character unintelligible to the learned men of the United States, to many of whom it is said to have been presented. The same angel afterwards appeared to three individuals, who call themselves Oliver Cowdry, David Whitmer, and Martin Harris, and showed them the plates. To Smith was given the power to translate the character, which he was enabled to do by looking through two semi-transparent stones, but as he was ignorant of the art of writing, Cowdry and the others wrote as Smith, the person who was first directed to dig for the plates, interpreted. They say that part of the plates escaped from them in a supernatural manner and are to be again revealed when the events of time shall require them.” The book which these men have pretended to translate from these sheets of gold has been printed, and they are now busily engaged in scattering copies of it throughout the country. They were recently in Painesville, Ohio, on their way to a land of promise, which is before them—they do not know exactly where—but somewhere beyond the Mississippi, where they intend establishing a New Jerusalem, into which will be gathered all the descendants of Mannassah. These men assert that this book “was written by the prophets of God during the period embracing the time for 600 years before and several hundred after the Christian era. It predicts, we understand, almost all events which have come to pass, such as the American Revolution, &c. and that there should be secret societies, and that men should be led on to destruction as by a rope of flax, said to mean Cable tow. All which they believe is proven by profane history—thus supporting the authenticity of the new revelation. But why the Deity should predict events, the knowledge of which would be so useful to the human race, merely to hide them in the earth until after their completion, we are not informed.” They also say that the world will shortly—within fifteen years at most—come to an end: But by this they only mean, that the incorrigible and perverse unbelievers will be destroyed, while the earth will become the abode only of the true believers. In Painesville, the three persons named above as the translators of the Bible, (who arelooked upon by their followers as prophets,) preached in the Methodist chapel, and then proceeded to Kirkland. At this place is a “common stock family” under the charge of Elder Rigdon, a Campbellite leader, who, together with nearly one hundred of his followers, were immediately baptized according to the ordinances of the new religion!”
Book of Mormon.— In the 2d number of the GEM, we gave a full length portrait of this bantling of wickedness and credulity. By a late Painsville, Ohio paper, we perceive that this pretended revelation from heaven has found some believers, and that there are preachers travelling about in those parts who pretend that it is the only revelation which men can safely live and die by. In Canandaigua, it is also said, that there is a book of Mormon preacher, who is attempting to push his way forward, in spite of all opposition. The reason for these efforts is obvious. When the work spoken of came before the world, it proved to be such a spawn of wickedness, that the press aimed a blow at it, and it fell, ere it had scarce seen the light. The getters-up therefore, seeing their hopes all blasted, and their names coupled with infamy, have determined to ‘make a raise’ on the public by some means, and thus they are going about “like roaring lions, seeking whom they may devour.”  We do not anticipate a very great turning to this heresy. The public are too much enlightened.
Book of Mormon.— Most of our readers, we presume, have heard of this pretended revelation, made to a certain few in and about Palmyra, revealing the fundamentals of a new religion. A ridiculous story was told about its discovery, golden plates were found in a stone box, a Mr. Somebody who could neither read nor write, was found able to translate them, and somebody else, equally ignorant, to transcribe them, and a worthy, honest but credulous farmer was found willing to be ruined by defraying the expense of publishing, and the Book of Mormon, as was to be expected, fell dead-born from the press. Here it was supposed the matter would rest, without causing even a sneer at the expense of the revelators. This however seems not to be the case. The disciples of Mormon have recently appeared in Ohio, and are propagating their new light with extraordinary rapidity, gulling the credulous, and laying the foundations broad and wide for a “New Jerusalem” about to be built; and now it seems the oracle has commenced its responses nearer home. Surely it was not rightly said that “in that hour the Heathen oracles became dumb for ever.” On Thursday of last week one of these seers of Mormon appeared in Canandaigua, delivered a discourse, and avowed his full belief that the book is a revelation from God, and of equal authenticity with the Old and New Testament. What number of hearers he had we are not informed, but for the honor of intelligent man, we hope and trust his followers are and will be, “few and far between.” This matter must be the ne plus ultra of fanaticism and delusion. If men will go beyond this in belief, verily there can be no end to their credulity.
Mr. Isham,—As the discovery of something, called a “new bible” is said lately to have been made, which challenges no less than to be a new Revelation of the Mind and Will of God, to his creature Man, I observe, that the account of the manner in which this pretended Codicil to the Will of God, was said to be communicated to mankind, in some place in the State of New York, is too absurd to deserve a serious refutation; yet such bold pretensions, may, perhaps, merit some consideration, especially, as some people are prone to believe whatever is asserted in a bold and confident manner.I cannot but consider this pretended “New Revelation,” not only as being unnecessary; but, on the supposition of its necessity (which I by no means grant) it does not come with evidence of its truth in any degree sufficient to demand belief. God has been pleased, in those books called the Old and New Testament, to communicate all that is necessary for man to know, whereby to regulate his faith and practice.Not only is love to God and man, inculcated therein as the great moving principle of action; but also each particular duty, in every relation of life, is enforced and explained, in such a manner, that nothing but perfect holiness of heart, and obedience to the will of God, as already revealed in his holy word, are necessary to render mankind as happy as human nature is capable of being.When God in mercy to sinful man, saw fit to give a Revelation of himself to Moses; that holy man very justly objected, unless God would favour him with such evidences of his divine mission, as rational beings, to whom he was sent, had a right to demand, to convince them that God had really sent him; and when required by Jehovah to proceed on his mission he urged the necessity of sufficient credentials to enforce belief; without which he very reasonably said, “They will not believe me nor hearken to my voice, for they will say, the Lord hath not appeared unto thee.”God immediately gave him the evidence of Miracles; such as the transformation of a rod to a serpent, &c.; and by a long seccession of the most stupendous miracles, addressed both to their reason and senses, convinced not only the Israelites, but also the Egyptians, and even unbelieving Pharaoh himself, of the reality of his mission from God.The giving of the Law on Mount Sinai was preceded, attended, and followed, by very extraordinary exhibitions of Divine power and goodness, in the performance of miracles of such a character, as challenged the full belief, that it was a revelation from God himself; and rendered unbelief most dreadfully criminal.When the old Dispensation, which was but a “shadow of good things to come,” gave way for the introduction of the new, through the ministry of Christ and his Apostles, when the Jews, who were strongly attached to Judaism, enquired who or what he was, he uniformly referred them to the Miracles of benevolence which he had wrought, as full and sufficient evidence of his Divine Character and Mission.As God “knows what is in man,” whom he has made a Moral Agent; and as Belief is not an act of the Will, but depends on the force with which Evidence strikes his mind—his Creator does not require rational creatures to believe any thing whatever, without sufficient evidence, or contrary to the evidence of their senses: neither does God reveal himself, and demand belief, unless he gives full and ample evidence of the truth of such Revelation: and as he governs the moral, as well as the natural world, by fixed Laws—rational creatures are not bound to believe any pretended revelation from him, unless accompanied with, and proven true by, the same kind of evidence with which he has hitherto established and proven, as those were by Moses, Christ and his Apostles.In conclusion, I remark, that if the above observations are correct, we are bound to consider the Apostles of this pretended new Revelation, either as wild Fanatics, or (what is more probable) as designing Villains, unless they can convince mankind of the truth of their mission from Heaven—either by imitating Moses, by dividing seas, and feeding their followers with Manna—or like our blessed Saviour, by healing the sick, restoring lost limbs, or raising the dead; or else by performing other miracles equally stupendous. I earnestly entreat all who favor this `newly discovered Bible,' as it is called, or its abettors, to consider the awful denunciation of God, near the close of his Holy Word: “For I testify unto every man that heareth the words of the Prophecy of this book: If any man ADD unto these things, God shall add unto him all the plagues which are written in this book!” H.Dec. 23d.
A new religious sect under the guidance of a Miss Campbell, has lately sprung up in Scotland, and numbers about 2000. They claim “direct inspiration, and the power of working miracles.” In what other particulars they resemble the followers of “JO SMITH JUNIOR,” we have not as yet been informed.
Farmington, Ont co. Jan. 1, 1821. Mr. EDITOR—I observe by the public prints, that this most clumsy of all impositions, known among us as Jo Smith’s “Gold Bible,” is beginning to excite curiosity abroad, from the novelty of its appearance, and the assurance of its advocates, who in imitation of too many of our religious sects, who have gone before them, very charitably (at least in this region) threaten all who have the hardihood to refuse to subscribe to their rhapsodies, with “dire damnation.”The two papers published in your village, for reasons easily explained, decline at present, throwing any light on this subject. To you, and you alone, do we look for an expose of the principal facts, and characters, as connected with this singular busines; I say singular, because it was hardly to be expected, that a mummery like the one in question, should have been gotten up at so late a period, and among a people, professing to be enlightened.It is not from a persecuting spirit, that I solicit an exposure, for my maxim is, that “error is never dangerous, where truth is free to combat it,” and that liberty of conscience in matters of religion should be allowed to all. Among the bundle of papers herewith sent to you for inspection, you will find little else, than a dry statement of facts, without much reference to time or order; you will perceive that I have attempted to throw all the light I could upon the “money digging mania,” which formerly pervaded this, and many other countries, which eventuated in the discovery of Jo Smith’s “Golden Treasure.”From your knowledge of ancient & modern history, by which you will be enabled to relieve the dryness of the subject, by bringing before the public parallel cases, there can be no doubt that much useful information may result from your labors. I shall from time to time, send you such information as I may collect on this piece of legerdemain. Yours, &c. PLAIN TRUTH.
GOLD BIBLE.— We have long been waiting, with considerable anxiety, to see some of our cotemporaries attempt to explain the immediate causes, which produced that anomaly in religion and literature, which has most strikingly excited the curiosity of our friends at a distance, generally known under the cognomen of the Book of Mormon, or the Gold Bible.The few notices heretofore given in the public prints, are quite vague and uncertain, and throw but a faint light on the subject. While some have evinced a spirit of rancor, without giving the whys and wherefores; others have attached an ominous consequence to this transaction, which may have a tendency to mislead the ignorant.It is our intention, so far as in us lies, to give, in accordance with the wishes of our friend “Plain Truth,” (whose communication will be found in this day’s paper,) a plain and unvarnished statement of facts, so far as they may come to our knowledge, which may, in our opinion, be considered as having any connection with the origin, rise, and progress of the book in question; so that our readers may not only judge of this, but of some other matters for themselves.By way of introduction, and illustration, we shall introduce brief notices and sketches of the superstitions of the ancients—the pretended science of alchymy [sic], by which it was vainly supposed, that the baser metals might be translated into gold—of Mahomet (properly Mahommed) and other ancient impostures—legends, or traditions respecting hidden treasures, with the SPIRIT, to whom ignorance has formerly given them in charge—tale of modern “money-diggers,” and other impostors—the Morristown Ghost, Rogers, Walters, Joanna Southcote, Jemima Wilkinson, &c.Our readers will perceive that we have an ample field before us;—how well we shall execute our task, time will determine—we shall publish only so much weekly as will not interfere with our variety. Postmastes and others, who can furnish us with interesting notices on any of the above subjects, shall receive a copy of our paper gratis.
Mormonism.— A young gentleman by the name of Whitmer, arrived here last week from Manchester, N. Y. the seat of wonders, with a new batch of revelations from God, as he pretended, which have just been communicated to Joseph Smith. As far as we have been able to learn their contents, they are a more particular description of the creation of the world, and a history of Adam and his family, and other sketches of the anti-deluvian world, which Moses neglected to record. But the more important part of the mission, was to inform the brethren that the boundaries of the promised land, or the New Jerusalem, had just been made known to Smith from God—the township of Kirtland, a few miles west of this, is the eastern line and the Pacific Ocean the western line; if the north and south lines have been described, we have not learned them. Orders were also brought to the brethren to sell no more land, but rather buy more. Joseph Smith and all his forces are to be on here soon to take possession of the promised land.
GOLD BIBLE, NO. 2. The page of history informs us, that from time immemorial, MAN has more or less been the dupe of superstitious error and imposition; so much so, that some writers in derision have called him “a religious animal,” and it often happens that the more absurd the dogma, the more greedily will it be swallowed, and the more absurd or unnatural the tenet, the more eagerly will it be embraced. Where ignorance is found to prevail, superstition and bigotry will abound; hence we discover among the most rude and barbarous nations, objects the most disgusting and abhorent, exhibited for the purpose of divine adoration and worship, and certain it is that untutored man has generally attributed to the divinities of his choice, passions and feelings like his own. The more ferocious and warlike tribes, worship deities, whose propensity for blood, is supposed to be in accordance with their own narrow views of the same subject; hence the origin of human sacrifices. The more mild and civilized (the Peruvians for instance) worshiped the sun and other heavenly bodies, believing them to possess the greatest good; their offerings were generally taken from the fruits of the earth, and blood seldom stained their altars. Man is as prone to be inconsistent, as he is to be superstitious; he will bestow thousands, under the idle pretense of assisting beings, of whom he has no certain knowledge, and with whom he can never be acquainted, while his next door neighbor may perish unheeded for lack of sustenance; and what may yet be considered a still greater anomaly in principle, is the conduct of the Hindoos, who believe in the transmigration of the soul, and consequently abstain from animal food, and the destruction of the brute creation, for fear of killing some of their kindred friends, whose souls may have taken up a temporary abode in some animal; while they immolate human victims on their altars.Our present business, however, is not to discuss the tenets of the innumerable sects and denominations, of christians or pagans, which now cover the face of the habitable globe, but to throw some light on the “rise and progress” of a sect, (if they may be called so,) who profess to be governed by the pseudo prophet Jo Smith, junior, who in addition to the precepts contained in the “Book of Mormon,” issues his inspired commands daily to his devoted followers, and no mandate of Mahomet was ever more implicitly obeyed.Agreeable to the plan laid down in our last paper we shall commence, or in other words preface our subject by giving brief notices of some of the most notorious impostors that have figured either in ancient or modern times, and connecting such other matters, as we may considerapplicable to the subject, or interesting to our readers. We shall commence with the impostor of Mecca. Jo Smith, as a military chieftan, or as a man of natural abilities, can bear no comparison with the author of the Koran, and it is only in their ignorance and impudence that a parallel can be found.Mahomet was born in the sixth century of the christian era, while Anashirwan, sur-named the Just was emperor of Persia. His father died leaving him an infant, and in low circumstances—he was maintained by his relations until he arrived at man’s estate. His education is said to have been entirely neglected, so much so, that it has been affirmed, that he could neither read nor write. At an early age he entered the service of Khadijah, a rich widow, whom he afterwards married. By this match, Mahomet was enabled to live at ease and formed the scheme of propagating a new religion, which he alleged should be the same as that professed by Adam, Noah, Abraham, and the other patriarchs, which should destroy idolatry and superstition, and introduce the worship of one God. In the first place he attempted to convert his own household, which appears to have been a work of some trouble, and for this purpose he retired to a cave in mount Hara, where he informed his wife that Gabriel had just appeared to him, and had made him an apostle of God: he also repeated to her, passages which he pretended had been revealed to him by the ministering angel.
Book of Mormon.—This book, otherwise called the Golden Bible, has excited considerable curiosity, in some parts of the country; and we learn that preachers have appeared in the state of Ohio and elsewhere, who profess their belief that it is of divine origin. On Thursday evening last, a preacher of this character, delivered a discourse, at the Town house in this village, to an assembly of two or three hundred people. In the course of his remarks, he explicitly avowed firm belief that the book of Mormon is a revelation from God; that he believed the golden plates on which it is said to have been inscribed in mysterious characters, had been discovered and decyphered by a very ignorant man, through the aid of divine assistance; and that he considered it as of equal authenticity with the Old and New Testaments. Whether these persons are really sincere in the profession of such belief, or whether their object is to promote the sale of the book, we will not undertake to determine.—Ontario Messenger.
The Golden Bible, or the Book of Mormon.—The believers in the sacred authenticity of this miserable production, are known by the name of “Mormonites,” and their book is commonly called “the book of Mormon.” It is asserted by them that their number in this vicinity is four hundred. In a conversation a few days since with a gentleman from Kirtland, well informed, and every way concerned to give us the truth, we were assured that their number in the family in that town were two hundred souls. We doubt not then, that their whole number in this county and Cuyahoga are at least four hundred.They have recently received an additional revelation from the prolific prophet, Smith, which is generally understood to say that Kirtland is within the precincts of the holy land; but by other is said to mean only that in that town will be a great gathering of mighty multitudes, preparatory to their westward general migration. They are therefore admonished to sell no more of their possessions but rather purchase, lest there shall not be room for the faithful. The admonition, however, arrived too late, as they have but fifty acres left, and the landholders refuse to sell them.They profess to receive sensible demonstrations of the presence of the Deity.—A few days since a young man gave information to some of his brethren that he was about to receive a message from heaven. They repaired to the spot designated, and there, as they solemnly assert, a letter descended from the skies and fell into the hands of the young man. The purport was to strengthen his faith and inform him that he would soon be called to the ministry. They declare that their solemn belief that this letter was written in heaven by the finger of God. They style of writing was the round Italian, and the letters of gold. The favored youth immediately attempted to copy the communication, but as fast as he wrote, the letters of the original disappeared until it entirely vanished. It is alleged that some of them have received white stones, promised in the 2d chapter of the Revelations. Such of them as have “the spirit” will declare that they see a white stone moving about the upper part of the room, and will jump and spring for it, until one more fortunate than the other catches it, but he alone can see it. Others however profess to hear it roll across the floor. These two stories, and others of a similar character, are told by them with solemn asseverations of their truth.Among them is a man of color, a chief man, who is sometimes seized with strange vagaries and odd concerns. The other day he is said to have jumped twenty-five feet down a wash band into a tree top without injury. He sometimes fancies he can fly.In Chardon, one man has torn away all the partitions of the lower part of a good two-story dwelling house. Here a large number live together. The food consisting of meat and vegetables, it is said, is placed on a table in a large pan, which is the whole table furniture. From this every inmate takes a piece of meant and a potato in his hand, and devours them as he walks about the room.—As to matters or apparel, and indeed other things, where any one wants what he has not, he takes it any where in the family where he can find it unoccupied. All things are common.
Waterloo, Jan. 26, 1830Mr. EDITOR— Elder S. Rigdon left this village on Monday morning last in the stage, for the “Holy Land,” where all the “Gold Bible” converts, have recently received a written command from God, through Jo Smith, junior, to repair with all convenient speed after selling off the property. This command, was at first resisted by such as had property, (the brethren from the neighboring counties being all assembled by special summons,) but after a night of fasting, prayer and trial, they all consented to obey the holy messenger.—Rigdon has for some time past been arranging matters with Smith for the final departure of the faithful for the “far west.” This man of many CREEDS, (Rigdon) appears to possess colloquial powers to a considerable degree, and before leaving this vicinity left us his blessing. He delivered a discourse at the Court House immediately preceding his departure, wherein he depicted in strong language, the want of “charity and brotherly love” among the prevailing sects and denominations of professing christians, and sorry I am to admit, that he had too much truth on his side with regard to this particular. After denouncing dreadful vengeance on the whole state of New-York, and this village in particular, and recommending to all such as wished to flee from “the wrath to come,” to follow him beyond the “western waters,” he took his leave. The Prophet, Spouse, and whole “holy family” (as they style themselves,) will follow Rigdon, so soon as their deluded or hypocritical followers, shall be able to dispose of what little real property they possess in this region; one farm (Whitmers) was sold a few days ago for $2,300. Their first place of destination is understood to be a few miles west of Painesville, Ohio, (the present place of the Elder’s residence) which is just within the east bounds of this new land of promise, which extends from thence to the Pacific Ocean, embracing a territory of 1500 miles in extent, from north to south. Yours respectfully,
GOLD BIBLE, NO. 3.Jo Smith, junior, according to the best information we can obtain on this subject, was born in the State of Vermont. His father emigrated to this country (Ontario county, N.Y.) about the year 1815, and located his family in the village of Palmyra. The age of this modern prophet is supposed to be about 24 years. In his person he is tall and slender—thin favored—having but little expression of countenance, other than that of dulness; his mental powers appear to be extremely limited, and from the small opportunity he has had at school, he made little or no proficiency, and it is asserted by one of his principle followers, (who also pretends to divine illuminations,) that Jo, even at this day is profoundly ignorant of the meaning of many of the words contained in the Book of Mormon.Joseph Smith, senior, the father of the personage of whom we are now writing, had by misfortune or otherwise been reduced to extreme poverty before he migrated to Western New-York. His family was large consisting of nine or ten children, among whom Jo junior was the third or fourth in succession. We have never been able to learn that any of the family were ever noted for much else than ignorance and stupidity, to which might be added, so far as it may respect the elder branch, a propensity to superstition and a fondness for everything marvelous.We have been credibly informed that the mother of the prophet, had connected herself with several religious societies before her present illumination; this also was the case with other branches of the family, but how far the father of the prophet, ever advanced in these particulars, we are not precisely informed, it however appears quite certain that the prophet himself never made any serious pretensions to religion until his late pretended revelation.We are not able to determine whether the elder Smith was ever concerned in money digging transactions previous to his emigration from Vermont, or not, but it is a well authenticated fact that soon after his arrival here he evinced a firm belief in the existence of hidden treasures, and that this section of country abounded in them.—He also revived, or in other words propagated the vulgar, yet popular belief that these treasures were held in charge by some evil spirit, which was supposed to be either the DEVIL himself, or some one of his most trusty favorites. This opinion however, did not originate by any means with Smith, for we find that the vulgar and ignorant from time immemorial, both in Europe and America, have entertained the same preposterous opinion.It may not be amiss in this place to mention that the mania of money digging soon began rapidly to diffuse itself through many parts of this country; men and women without distinction of age or sex became marvellous wise in the occult sciences, many dreamed, and others saw visions disclosing to them deep in the bowels of the earth, rich and shining treasures, and to facilitate those mighty mining operations, (money was usually if not always sought after in the night time,) divers devices and implements were invented, and although the spirit was [92] always able to retain his precious charge, these discomfited as well as deluded beings, would on a succeeding night return to their toil, not in the least doubting that success would eventually attend their labors. Mineral rods and balls, (as they were called by the impostor who made use of them,) were supposed to be infallible guides to these sources of wealth—“peep stones” or pebbles, taken promiscuously from the brook or field, were placed in a hat or other situation excluded from the light, when some wizzard or witch (for these performances were not confined to either sex) applied their eyes, and nearly starting their balls from their sockets, declared they saw all the wonders of nature, including of course, ample stores of silver and gold.It is more than probable that some of these deluded people, by having their imaginations heated to the highest pitch of excitement, and by straining their eyes until they were suffused with tears, might have, through the medium of some trifling emission of the ray of light, receive imperfect images on the retina, when their fancies could create the rest. Be this however as it may, people busied themselves in consulting these blind oracles, while the ground was nightly opened in various places and men who were too lazy or idle to labor for bread in the day time, displayed a zeal and persevereance in this business worthy of a better cause.
A friend in Chagrin, Ohio, gives us the following information, which, with the additional explanations, will, we trust, be as interesting to our readers, as it was to us.—We say interesting, though it is shocking and abhorrent to every good principle and better feeling of the human heart.“It would be highly gratifying to the friends of universal holiness and happiness, in this region of fanatics, if some mastering friend of commanding talents, could visit them. There is not an individual, to my knowledge, in the whole Lake country, who pretends to speak, in public, of the universal love of God.I said ‘region of fanatics,’ for the like has not occurred since the days of the Crusaders to redeem the holy Sepulchre. Hundreds, in this vicinity, have become fanatics, complete—call themselves apostles, prophets, &c.—perform miracles—call down fire from heaven—impart the Holy Ghost by the laying on of hands, and say that they shall be renovated and live a thousand years. The old women say that they shall again become young, and become fruitful and replenish the earth. They have all things in common, and dispense with the marriage covenant. They assume the general name of Mormonites. They have a new bible which they call the Book of Mormon. Many have joined from whom we might expect better things.”J.M.H.The above named sect (if sect it can be called) took its rise within the last two or three years, in this state, from a man by the name of Joseph Smith, Jr. a man of subtlety and cunning, but of no learning, and as we are informed, much worse than no character. Judging from the book he has published, we are satisfied he must be a real, unprincipled, villainous impostor. A book of nearly 600 pages, entitled, “The Book of Mormon,” bearing Smith’s name as author and proprietor, has been published during the past year. It claims to be a translation of “An account written by the hand of Mormon upon plates taken from the plates of Nephi.” The author says in his preface to the reader, “I would also inform you that the plates of which hath been spoken, were found in the township of Manchester, Ontario county, N.Y.”[column 2]The miserable impostor who publishes this book, pretends that the plates were plates of gold containing the record written by Mormon—that having “by the gift and power of God,” translated a part of the ancient record contained on the golden plates, some person or persons stole from him what he had translated; he was commanded by God not to translate that over again, but to translate other parts of the record on the plates; which thing he did, and had thus failed satan’s attempt to overthrow this revelation, &c. This volume is divided into the 1st and 2d Book of Nephi, the Books of Jacob, Enos, Jarem, Omni, Mosiah, Alma, Helaman, Nephi, Mormon, Ether and Moroni. At the close, there is what is called “The Testimony of three witnesses,” stating that they saw the plates of gold from which this Smith translated his book, and know that he did it by the gift and power of God, that it is “a record of the people of Nephi, and also of the Lamanites, his brethren, and also of the people of Jared, which came from the tower of which hath been spoken.”—That “an angel of God came down from heaven, and he brought and laid before our eyes, that we beheld and saw the plates” &c., signed by Oliver Cowdry, David Whitmer, and Martin Harris. Then follows another page of about the same import, entitled, “And also the testimony of eight witnesses,” and signed by four Whitmers, one Page, and three Smiths. The whole book is filled with blasphemous nonsense, silly stories, pretended prophecies, history, &c. of people and events immediately succeeding the flood, and during the reign of the kings of Israel and Judah, and extending to the times and events connected with the Messiah’s reign; interlarded with unnumbered profanations of the names of the Deity and Jesus Christ. It is a most bungling attempt to imitate the ancient English and Bible phraseology. Much of the language is borrowed from the Bible and inserted in the book, after murdering the English of it: and the Almighty, by the sentences ascribed to him, is made out a most miserable grammarian; insomuch that some have sarcastically remarked that, “if the Deity ever indited the language here ascribed to him, it must have been in his younger days, before he had become much acquainted with the proper analogy of language!”On the whole, it is one of the most abominable pieces of imposition and blasphemy, that has of late been attempted to be palmed upon community, in the name of a new revelation. And one would suppose that in this enlightened age, none could be found ignorant and stupid enough to be cheated by the imposture. There is, however, one remarkable fact which should be stated in connexion with this subject. It is this: That notwithstanding mankind will be rational on all other subjects but that of religion, there is scarcely any imposture of this character, however absurd or monstrous [column 3] it may be, that has ever been introduced into the world, but what has had its supporters and made its proselytes. And we have little doubt that were a person now to appear on the stage and assert that he had been an inhabitant of the moon for five hundred years, and had finally fallen on this earth to make a new revelation to men, he would find followers and make proselytes, who would be fools enough to believe and profess faith in his new theory. So prone are mankind to the marvelous in religion, when backed, as in this case, by the threats of endless misery! S.
DELUSIONS. EVERY age of the world has produced impostors and delusions. Jannes and Jambres withstood Moses, and were followed by Pharaoh, his court, and clergy. They for some time supported their pretensions, much to the annoyance of the cause of the Israelites and their leader Moses.To say nothing of the false prophets of the Jewish age, the diviners, soothsayers, magicians, and all the ministry of idols among the Gentiles, by which the nations were so often deceived, the impostors which have appeared since the Christian era would fill volumes of the most lamentable details ever read. The false Messiahs which have afflicted the Jews since the rejection of Jesus of Nazareth, have more than verified all the predictions of the Faithful and True Witness. No less than twenty-four distinguished false Messiahs have disturbed the Jews. Many were deceived, and myriads lost their lives through their impostures. Some peculiar epochs were distinguished for the number and impudence of these impostors. If the people had fixed upon any year as likely to terminate their dispersions, and as the period of their return, that year rarely failed to produce a Messiah. Hence, in the twelfth century no less than ten false Messiahs appeared.The year 1666 was a year of great expectation, and gave birth to the appearance of one of the most remarkable of the false Christs. “Great multitudes marched from unknown parts to theremote deserts of Arabia, and they were supposed to be the ten tribes of Israel, who had been dispersed for many ages. It was said that a ship was arrived in the north part of Scotland with sails and cordage of silk, that the mariners spoke nothing but Hebrew, and on the sails was this motto: “The Twelve Tribes of Israel.” Then it was that Sabati Levi appeared at Smyrna and professed to be the Messiah.” The Jews gave up their business and attended to him He obtained one Nathan in Jerusalem to pass for his Elias or forerunner. Nathan prophesied for him, and the Jews became very penitent, and reformed under the expectation that the Messiah would appear in two years. “Some fasted so long that they died—some endured melting wax to be dropped on their flesh—some rolled in snow—many whipped themselves. Superfluities in dress and household furniture were dispensed with; property was sold to large amounts, and immense contributions were made to the poor. Though he met with much opposition, his followers increased, and began in large numbers to prophesy and fall into ecstasies. Four hundred men and women prophesied of his growing kingdom, and young infants who could hardly speak would plainly pronounce “Sabati, Messiah and Son of God.” The people were for a time possessed, and voices were heard from their bowels. Some fell into trances, foamed at the mouth, recounted their future prosperity, their visions of the Lion of Judah, and the triumphs of Sabati.”“When he was brought before the Magistrates, someaffirmed the saw a pillar of fire between him and the Cadi or Magistrates, and others actually swore that they saw it. This the credulous Jews believed.—Those who would not believe in him were shunned as excommunicated persons, and all intercourse with them prohibited.“The Grand Seignor determined to try his faith by stripping him naked and setting him a mark for his archers; but rather than subject himself to this test, he turned Mahomedan, to the great confusion of the Jews.”We have been thus particular in giving a few of the incidents of the life of this impostor, as a specimen of the others; and because of some remarkable analogies between him and the present New York impostor.Numerous have been the impostors among christians since the great apostacy began; especially since, and at the time of the Reformation. Munzer, Stubner, and Stork, were conspicuous in the beginning of the 16th century. “These men taught that among christians who had the precepts of the Gospel to guide them, and the Spirit of God to direct them, the office of magistracy was not only unnecessary, but an unlawful encroachment on their spiritual liberty; that [85] the distinctions occasioned by birth, rank, or wealth, should be abolished; that all christians should put their possessions into one common stock, and live together in that state of equality which becomes members of the same family; and that polygamy was not incompatible with either the Old or New Testament. They related many visions and revelations which they had from above; but failing to propagate their views by these means, they attempted to propagate them by arms. Many Catholics joined them, and in the various insurrections which they effected, 100,000 souls are said to have been sacrificed.”Since the Millennium and the evils of sectarianism have been the subjects of much speaking and writing, impostures have been numerous. In the memory of the present generation, many delusions have been propagated and received. The Shakers, a sect instituted by Anna Lesse, in 1774, have not yet quite dwindled away. This Elect Lady, as they style her, was the head of this party, and gave them a new Bible. “They assert that she spoke seventy-two languages, and conversed with the dead. Through her all blessings flow to her followers—She appointed the sarced dance and the fantastic song, and consecrated shivering, swooning, and falling down, acts of acceptable devotion. They are for a common stock, and rank marriage among the works of the flesh.—They are plain in their apparel, and assume the aspect of the friars and nuns of Catholic superstition.”The Barkers, Jumpers, and Mutterers of the present age, need not be mentioned here. Nor need we detail the history of a Miss Campbell, who, in good old Scotland a year or two since, came back from the dead and had the gift of tongues; who was believed in by several ministers of the Church of Scotland, and some distinguished members of the Scotch Bar. But we shall proceed to notice the most recent and the most impudent delusion which has appeared in our time. The people that have received this imposture are calledTHE MORMONITES.I have just examined their Bible, and will first notice its contents. It is called “The Book of Mormon, an account written by the hand of Mormon, upon plates taken from the plates of Nephi; wherefore it is an abridgement of the Record of the people of Nephi, and also of the Lamanites, written to the Lamanites, which are a remnant of the House of Israel, and also to Jew and Gentile: written by way of Commandment, and also by the Spirit of Prophecy and of Revelation.”—“By Joseph Smith, Junior, Author and Proprietor.”—From plates dug out of the earth in the township of Manchester, Ontario county, New York—Palmyra, printed by E. B. Grandin, for the Author, 1830. It is a collection of Books said to have been written by different persons during the interval of 1020 years.—The 1st and second Books of Nephi occupy 122 pages; the Book of Jacob the brother of Nephi occupies 21; that of Enos 3; that of Jarom 2; that of Omni 4; the Words of Mormon 3; the Book of Mosiah 68; that of Alma 186; that of Helaman 44; that of Nephi the son of Helaman 66; that of Mormon 20; that of Ether 35; and that of Moroni 14 pages; making in all 588 octavo pages.This romance—but this is for it a name too innocent—begins with the religions adventures of one Lehi, whose wife was Sariah, and their four sons, Laman, Lemuel, Sam, and Nephi. Lehi lived in Jerusalem all his life, up till the 1st year of Zedekiah, King of Judah; and when the prophets appeared foretelling the utter destruction of Jerusalem, Lehi humbled himself, and after various visions and revelations, started with his sons into the wilderness. Lehi, before his departure, forgot to bring with him the records of his family, and that of the Jews; but Nephi, his younger son, with much pious courage, returned, and succeeded in getting upon plates of brass the Records of the Jews from the Creation down to the 1st year of Zedekiah, King of Judah—and also the prophets including many prophecies delivered by Jeremiah.From the records it appeared that this Lehi was a son of Joseph. He prevailed on one Ishmael and his family to accompany him into the wilderness, whose daughters the sons of Lehi took for wives. [86]Lehi was a greater prophet than any of the Jewish prophets, and uttered all the events of the christian era, and developed the records of Matthew, Luke, and John, 600 years before John the Baptist was born.—These pilgrims travelled several days journey in some wilderness, “a South, South-east direction, along the borders of the Red Sea.” A ball with pointers on it, inscribed with various intelligence, legible at proper times, was the pillar and index in passing through the wilderness for many, very many days. By their bow and arrow they lived for eight years, travelling an easterly course from Jerusalem, until they came to a great sea. By divine revelation Nephi constructed a ship, and although opposed by his unbelieving brethren, being greatly assisted by the Holy Spirit, he succeeded in launching her safely, and got all his tribe, with all their stock of seeds, animals, and provisions, safely aboard. They had “a compass,” which none but Nephi knew how to manage; but the Lord had promised them a fine land, and after many perils and trials, and a long passage, they safely arrived at the land of promise. Nephi made brazen plates soon after his arrival in America, for that was the land of promise to them, and on these plates he marked their peregrinations and adventures, and all the prophecies which God gave to him concerning the future destinies of his people, and the human race.After his father’s death, his brethren rebelled against him. They finally separated in the wilderness, and became the heads of different tribes, often in the lapse of generations making incursions upon each other. The Nephites, like their father, for many generations were good christians, believers in the doctrines of he Calvinists and Methodists, and preaching baptism and other christian usages hundreds of years before Jesus Christ was born!Before Nephi died, which was about 55 years from the flight of Lehi from Jerusalem, he had preached to his people every thing which is now preached in the state of New York, and anointed or ordained his brother Jacob priest over his people, called the Nephites. Jacob brought up his son Enos “in the nurture and admonition of the Lord,” gave him the plates, and left him successor in office over the people of Nephi. Enos says “there came a voice to me, saying, Enos thy sins are forgiven thee, and thou shalt be blessed. And, I sayeth, Lord how is it done. And, he sayeth unto me, Because of they faith in Christ, whom thou has not heard nor seen.” page 143. Enos died 179 years from the hegira of Lehi; consequently, this happened 431 years before Jesus Christ was born. He was a contemporary with Nehemiah, and may we not say how much wiser and more enlightened were the Nephites in America than the Jews at their return to Jerusalem!!Enos gave the plates to Jarom, his son. In his time “they kept the law of Moses and the Sabbath day holy to the Lord.” During the priesthood and reign of Enos, there were many commotions and wars between his people and the Lamanites. Then the sharp pointed arrow, the quiver, and the dart, were invented. Jarom delivered his plates to his son Omni, and gave up the ghost 238 years from the flight of Lehi. Omni died 276 years from the hegira, and gave the plates to his son Amaron, who, in the year 320, gave them to his brother Chemish; he, to his son Abinadom; he, to his son Amaleki; and he, having no son, gave them to the just and pious King Benjamin.King Benjamin had three sons, Mosiah, Helorum, and Helaman, whom he educated in all the learning of his fathers. To Mosiah he delivered up the plates of Nephi, the ball which guided them through the wilderness, and the sword of one Laban, of mighty renown. King Benjamin addressed his people from the new temple which they had erected, for they had, even then, built a temple, synagogues, and a tower, in the New World.King Benjamin assembled the people to sacrifice according to the law around the new temple; and he enjoined upon them, at the same time, the christian institutions, and gave them a patriarchal valedictory. After they had heard him speak, and had offered up their sacrifices, theyfell down and prayed in the following words: “O have mercy, and apply the atoning blood [87] of Christ, that we may receive forgiveness of our sins, and our hearts may be purified: for we believe in Jesus Christ the Son of God, who created Heaven and Earth, and all things, who shall come down among the children of men.” Then the Spirit of the Lord fell upon them and they were filled with joy, having received a remission of their sins.” p. 162.King Benjamin ordered his people to take upon them the name of Christ, and in these remarkable words—“There is no other name given whereby salvation cometh; therefore I would that you should take upon you the name of Christ, all you that have entered into the covenant with God that ye should be obedient unto the end of your lives.” p. 166. They all took upon them the name of Christ; and he, having ordained them priests and teachers, and appointed his son Mosiah to reign in his stead, gave up the ghost, 476 years after Lehi’s escape from Jerusalem, and 124 before Christ was born. Mosiah gave the plates of brass and all “the things which he had kept” to Alma, the son of Alma, who was appointed “chief judge and high priest,” the people willing to have no King, and Mosiah died 569 years from the time Lehi left Jerusalem.In the 14th year of the judges, and 69 years before the birth of Jesus, they sent out missionary priests who preached through all the tribes of the country against all vices; “holding forth the coming of the Son of God, his sufferings, death and resurrection—and that he should appear unto them after his resurrection: and this the people did hear with great joy and gladness.” p. 268.Alma’s Book reaches down to the end of the 39th year of the judges. These were wonderful years—many cities were founded, many battles were fought, fortifications reared, letters written, and even in one year a certain Hagoth built an exceeding large ship, and launched it forth into the West Sea. In this embarked many of the Nephites. This same ship builder the next year built other ships—one was lost with all its passengers and crew.—p. 406.Many prophecies were pronounced: one that in 400 years after the coming of Christ the Nephites would lose their religion. During the time of the judges, many were called christians by name, and “baptism unto repentance” was a common thing. “And it came to pass that they did appoint priests and teachers throughout all the land, over all the churches.” p. 349. “And those who did belong to the church were faithful; yea, all those who were true believers in Christ took upon them gladly the name of Christ, or christians, as they were called, because of their belief in Christ.” p. 301. “And it came to pass that there were many who died, firmly believing that their souls were redeemed by the Lord Jesus Christ: thus they went out of the world rejoicing.” p. 353. “The word was preached by Helaman, Shiblon, Corianton, Amnon, and his brethren, &c. yea, and all those who had been ordained by the holy order of God, being baptized unto repentance, and sent forth to preach unto the people.” p. 362. This happened in the 19th year of the judges, 72 years before the birth of Jesus. Before this time synagogues with pulpits were built, “for the Zoramites,” a sort of Episcopalians, “gathered themselves together on one day of the week, which day they called the day of the Lord”—“and they had a place which was high and lifted up, which held but one man, who read prayers, the same prayers every week; and this place was called Rameumptom, which being interpreted is the Holy Stand.” p. 311.The book of Helaman reacheth down to the 90th year of the judges, and to the year preceding that in which the Messiah was born. During the period embraced in Helaman’s narrative, many ten thousands were baptized. “And behold the Holy Spirit of God did come down from heaven, and did enter into their hearts, and they were filled as with fire, and they could speak forth marvellous words.” p. 421. Masonry was invented about this time; for men began to bind themselves in secret oaths to aid one another in all things, [88] good and evil. p. 424. Powers of loosing and binding in heaven were conferred upon Nephi, the son of Helaman, and all miraculous powers, such as the Apostles possessed. One Samuel, also, foretold that the Christ would be born in five years, and that the night before should be as light as day; and that the day of his death should be a day of darkness, like the night.” p. 445.The Book of this Nephi commences with the birth of the Messiah, 600 years from the departure of Lehi from Jerusalem. In the midst of the threats of the infidels to slaughter the faithful, the sun set; but lo! the night was as clear as mid day, and from that period they changed their era, and counted time as we do. As star also appeared, but it is not stated how it could be seen in a night as bright as day—but it was universally seen throughout all the land, to the salvation of the pious from the threats of their enemies.The terrors of the day of his death are also stated, and in the 34th year from his nativity, after his resurrection, he descended from heaven and visited the people of Nephi. Jesus called upon them to examine his hands and his sides, as he did Thomas, though none of them had expressed a doubt. Two thousand five hundred men, women and children, one by one, examined him, and then worshipped him. He commanded Nephi to baptize, and gave him the words which he was to use, viz: “Having authority given me of Jesus Christ, I baptize you in the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost. Amen.” He commissioned eleven others, who, with Nephi, were his twelve American Apostles, and promised himself to baptize their converts “with fire and with the Holy Spirit.”He delivers them the Sermon upon the Mount, and some other sayings recorded in Matthew, Mark, Luke, and John. He healed all their diseases, and prayed for their children; but the things spoken were so great and marvellous that they could not be spoken nor written.He ordained one to administer the supper, who alone had authority to dispense it to the disciples baptized in his name. The only new commandments which were given to the American christians on his occasional visits which were repeated, were—“Pray in your families unto the Father, always in my name, that your wives and your children may be blessed.” “Meet often, and forbid no man from coming unto you when you shall meet together.” p. 492.Nephi was chief among the 12 Apostles: he baptized himself, and then baptized the eleven, whose names were Timothy, Jonas, Mathoni, and Mathonihah, Kumen, Kumenonhi, Jeremiah, Shimnon, Jonas, Zedekiah, and Isaiah. “They were baptized in fire and the Holy Ghost.” Not a new word, however, could be written in addition to those found in the New Testament; for although he spake for several days to these American disciples, none of the new and marvellous sayings could be uttered or written!! He inspected the plates of Nephi, and only found one omission, which was, that he failed to mention the resurrection of many saints in America at the time of the tempest and earthquake. He commanded these Nephites to be called christians.The Book of Nephi the son of Nephi, gives, in 4 pages, the history of 320 years after Christ. In the 36th year, all the inhabitants of the land were converted. There was a perfect community, and no disputations in the land for 170 years. Three of the American Apostles were never to die, and were seen 400 years after Christ; but what has become of them no one can tell, except Cowdery, Whitmer, and Harris, the three witnesses of the truth of the plates of Nephi, be these three immortal men. Towards the close of the history of Nephi or the record of Ammaron, sects and divisions and battles became frequent, and all goodness had almost left the continent in the year 320.Mormon appears next in the drama, the recording angel for the whole matter, who, by the way, was a mighty general and great christian; he commanded in one engagement 42,000 men against the Lamanites!!! He was no Quaker! This dreadful battle was fought A. D. 330. The Lamanites took [89] South America for themselves, and gave North America to the Nephites. Mormon was very orthodox, for he preached in these words, A. D. 362:—“That Jesus was the very Christ, and the very God.” He must have heard of the Arian controversy by some angel!!Moroni finishes what Mormon, his father, left undone, and continues the history till A. D. 400. He pleads that no one shall disbelieve his record because of its imperfections!! and declares that none who receive it will condemn it on account of its imperfections, and for not doing so, the same shall know greater things. p. 532. “He that condemneth it shall be in danger of hell fire.” He laments the prevalency of free masonry in the times when his Book should be dug up out of the earth, and proves that miracles will never cease; because God is the same yesterday, to-day, and forever—consequently, must always create suns, moons, and stars, every day!! He exhorted to take heed that none be baptized without telling their experience, nor partake of the Sacrament of Christ unworthily”!! p. 537.Moroni, in the conclusion of his Book of Mormon, says, if his plates had been larger he would have written in Hebrew; but because of this difficulty, he wrote in the “Reformed Egyptian,” being handed down and altered unto us according to our manner of speech.” p. 538. “Condemn me not,” says he, “because of mine imperfections; neither my father, because of his imperfections; neither them which have written before him; but rather give thanks unto God that he hath made manifest unto you our imperfections, that you may learn to be more wise than we have been.” p. 538. A very necessary advice, indeed!!Moroni writes the Book of Ether, containing an account of the people of Jared, who escaped from the building of the tower of Babel unconfounded in his language. These people of Jared God marched before in a cloud, and directed them through the wilderness, and instructed them to build barges to cross seas; and finally they built eight barges, air-tight, and were commanded to make a hole in the top to admit air, and one in the bottom to admit water; and in them were put 16 windows of molten stone, which, when touched by the finger of Jesus, became as transparent as any glass, and gave them light under “the mountain waves,” and when above the water. He that touched these stones appeared unto the brother of Jared, and said: “Behold I am Jesus Christ. I am the Father and the Son.” Two of these stones were sealed up with the plates, and became the spectacles of Joseph Smith, according to a prediction uttered before Abraham was born. It was also foretold in the Book of Ether, written by Moroni, that he that should find the plates should have the privilege of shewing the plates unto those who shall assist to bring forth this work; and unto three shall they be shewn by the power of God: wherefore they shall of a surety know that these things are true.” p. 548. And the eight barges, air-tight, made like ducks, after swimming and diving 344 days, arrived on the coasts of the land of promise. The Book of Ether relates the wars and carnage amongst these people. In the lapse of generations they counted two millions of mighty men, besides women and children, slain; and finally, they were all killed but one, and he fell to the earth as if he had no life. So ends the Book of Ether, p. 573.The book of Moroni details the manner of ordaining priests and teachers, the manner of administering ordinances, and the epistles of Mormon to his son Moroni. Moroni seals up the record A. D. 420, and assures the world that spiritual gifts shall never cease, only through unbelief. And when the plates, of Nephi should be dug up out of the earth, he declares that “men should ask God the Eternal Father the name of Christ: if these things are not true.” “If with a sincere heart and real intent, having faith in Christ, such prayers are made, ye shall know the truth of all things,” p. 586.The testimony of Oliver Cowdery, David Whitmer, and Martin Harris, asserting that they saw the plates, is appended. They also testify that they know [90] that they have been translated by the gift and power of God, for his voice had declared it unto them.Another testimony is appended, signed by four Whitmers, one Hiram Page, and three Smiths, affirming that they saw the plates, handled them, and that Smith has got the plates in his possession.Such is an analysis of the book of Mormon, the Bible of the Mormonites. For noticing of which I would have asked forgiveness from all my readers, had not several hundred persons of different denominations believed in it. On this account alone has it become necessary to notice it, and for the same reason we must examine its pretensions to divine authority; for it purports to be a revelation from God. And in the first place, we shall examine its internal evidences.INTERNAL EVIDENCES.It admits the Old and New Testaments to contain the revelations, institutions, and commandments of God to Patriarchs, Jews, and Gentiles, down to the year 1830—and always, as such, speaks of them and quotes them. This admission at once blasts its pretentions to credibility. For no man with his eyes open can admit both books to have come from God. Admitting the Bible now received to have come from God, it is impossible that the book of Mormon came fromthe same Author. For the following reasons:—I. Smith, its real author, as ignorant and as impudent a knave as ever wrote a book, betrays the cloven foot in basing his whole book upon a false fact, or a pretended fact, which makes God a liar. It is this:—With the Jews God made a covenaut at Mount Sinai, and instituted a priesthood, and a high priesthood. The priesthood he gave to the tribe of Levi, and the high priesthood to Aaron and his sons for an everlasting priesthood. He separated Levi, and covenanted to give him this office irrevocably while ever the temple stood, or till the Messiah came. “Then, says God, Moses shall appoint Aaron and his sons, and they shall wait on their priest’s office, and the stranger, (the person of another family,) who cometh nigh, shall be put to death.” Numbers iii. 10. “And the priests, the sons of Levi, shall come near; for them the Lord thy God hath chosen to minister unto him, and to bless in the name of the Lord, and by their word shall every controversy and every stroke be tried.” Deut. xxi. 5. Korah, Dathan, and Abiram, with 250 men of renown, rebelled against a part of the institution of the priesthood, and the Lord destroyed them in the presence of the whole congregation. This was to be a memorial that no stranger invade any part of the office of the priesthood. Num. xvi 40. “Fourteen thousand and seven hundred of the people were destroyed by a plague for murmuring against this memorial.In the 18th chapter of Numbers the Levites are again given to Aaron and his sons, and the priesthood confirmed to them with this threat—“The stranger that cometh nigh shall be put to death.” “Even Jesus, says Paul, were he on earth, could not be a priest; for he was of a tribe concerning which Moses spake nothing of priesthood.” Heb. vii. 13. So irrevocable was the grant of the priesthood to Levi, and of the high priesthood to Aaron, that no stranger dare approach the altar of God which Moses established. Hence, Jesus himself was excluded from officiating as priest on earth according to the lawThis Joseph Smith overlooked in his impious fraud, and makes his hero Lehi spring from Joseph. And just as soon as his sons return with the roll of his lineage, ascertaining that he was of the tribe of Joseph, he and his sons acceptably “offer sacrifices and burnt offerings to the Lord,”—p. 15. Also it is repeated, p. 18—Nephi became chief artificer, ship-builder, and mariner; was scribe, prophet, priest, and king unto his own people, and “consecrated Jacob and Joseph the sons of his father priests to God and teachers—almost 600 years before the fulness of the times of the Jewish economy was completed, p. 72. Nephi represents himself withal “as under the law of Moses,” p. 105. They build a temple in the new world, and in 55 years after they leave Jerusalem, make a new priesthood which God approbates. A high [91] priest is also consecrated and yet they are all the while “teaching the law of Moses, and exhorting the people to keep it!!! p. 146, 209. Thus God is represented as instituting, approbating, and blessing a new priesthood from the tribe of Joseph, concerning which Moses gave no commandment concerning priesthood. Although God had promised in the law of Moses that if any man, not of the tribe and family of Levi and Aaron, should approach the office of priest, he would surely die; he is represented by Smith as blessing, approbating, and sustaining another family in this appropriated office. The God of Abraham or Joseph Smith must then be a liar!! And who will hesitate to pronounce him an impostor? This lie runs through his records for the first 600 years of his story.II. This ignorant and impudent liar, in the next place, makes the God of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, violate his covenants with Israel and Judah concerning the land of Canaan, by promising a new land to a pious Jew. If a company of reprobate Jews had departed from Jerusalem and the temple in the days of Zedekiah, and founded a new colony, it would not have been so incongruous. But to represent God as inspiring a devout Jew and a prophet, such as Lehi and Nephi are represented by Smith, with a resolution to forsake Jerusalem and God’s own house, and to depart from the land which God swore to their fathers so long as they were obedient; and to guide by miracle and bless by prodigies a good man in forsaking God’s covenant and worship—is so monstrous an error that language fails to afford a name for it. It is to make God violate his own covenants, and to set at nought his own promises, and to convert his own curses into blessings. Excision from the commonwealth of Israel, and banishment from Jerusalem and the temple, were the greatest curses the law of Moses knew. But Smith makes a good and pious Jew the subject of this curse, and sends him off into the inhospitable wilderness, disinherits him in Canaan, and makes him more happy in forsaking the institutions of Moses, more intelligent in the wilderness, and more prosperous in adversity, than even the Jews in their best days, in the best of lands, and under the best of all governments!!! The impostor was too ignorant of the history of the Jews and the nature of the covenants of promise to have even alluded to them in his book if he had not supposed that he had the plates of Moses in his own keeping as he had his “molton plates” of Nephi. To separate a family from the nation of Israel, was to accumulate all the curses of the law upon that family, Deut. xxix. 21.III. He has more of the Jews living in the new world than could have been numbered any where else, even in the days of John the Baptist; and has placed them under a new dynasty. The sceptre, with him, has departed from Judah, and a law giver from among his descendants, hundreds of years before Shiloh came; and King Benjamin is a wiser and more renowned King than King Solomon. He seems to have gone upon an adage which saith;—“the more marvellous the more credible the tale,” and the less of fact, and the more of fiction the more intelligible and reasonable the narrative.IV. He represents the temple worship as continued in his new land of promise contrary to every precept of the Law, and so happy are the people of Nephi as never to shed a tear on account of excision, nor to turn an eye toward Jerusalem or God’s temple. The pious Jews in the captivity turned their faces to Jerusalem and the holy place, and remembered God’s promises concerning the place where he recorded his name. They hung their harps upon the willow trees, and could not sing the songs of Zion in a foreign land; but the Nephites have not a single wish for Jerusalem, for they can, in their wigwam temple, in the wilderness of America, enjoy more of God’s presence than the most righteous Jew could enjoy in that house of which David had rather be a door-keeper than to dwell in the tabernacles of men. And all this too, when God’s only house of prayer, according to his covenant with Israel, stood in Jerusalem.V. Malachi, the last of the Jewish prophets, commanded Israel to regard [92] the law of Moses till the Messiah came. And Moses commanded them to regard him till the Great Prophet came. But Nephi and Smith’s prophets institute ordinances and observances for the Jews subversive of Moses 500 years before the Great Prophet came.VI. Passing over a hundred similar errors, we shall next notice his ignorance of New Testament matters and things, The twelve Apostles of the Lamb are said by Paul to have developed certain secrets which were hid from ages and generations, which Paul says were ordained before the world to their glory—that they should have the honor of announcing them. But Smith makes his pious hero Nephi 600 years before the Messiah began to preach, disclose these secrets concerning the calling of the Gentiles, and the blessings flowing through the Messiah to Jews and Gentiles, which Paul says were hid from ages and generations “which in other ages was not made known unto the sons of men as it is now revealed unto us, the holy Apostles and Prophets, by the Spirit: that the Gentiles should be fellow heirs, and of the same body, and partakers of his promise in Christ by the gospel.” Smith makes Nephi express every truth found in the writings of the Apostles concerning the calling and blessing of the Gentiles, and even quotes the 11th chapter of the Romans and many other passages before he had a son grown in the wilderness able to aim an arrow at a deer. Paul says these things were secrets and unknown until his time; but Smith makes Nephi say the same things 600 years before Paul was converted! One of the two is a false prophet. Mormonites take your choice!VII. This prophet Smith, through his stone spectacles, wrote on the plates of Nephi, in his book of Mormon, every error and almost every truth discussed in New York for the last ten years. He decides all the great controversies;—infant baptism, ordination, the trinity, regeneration, repentance, justification, the fall of man, the atonement, transubstantiation, fasting, penance, church government, religious experience, the call to the ministry, the general resurrection, eternal punishment, who may baptize, and even the question of free masonary, republican government, and the rights of man. All these topics are repeatedly alluded to. How much more benevolent and intelligent this American apostle than were the holy Twelve and Paul to assist them!!! He prophesied of all these topics, and of the apostacy, and infalliby decides by his authority every question. How easy to prophecy of the past or of the present time!!VIII. But he is better skilled in the controversies in New York than in the geography or history of Judea. He makes John baptize in the village of Bethabara, (page 22) and says Jesus was born in Jerusalem, p. 240. Great must be the faith of the Mormonites in this new Bible!!! The mariners compass was only known in Europe about 300 years ago; but Nephi knew all about steam-boats and the compass 2400 years ago.IX. He represents the christian institution as practised among his Israelites before Jesus was born. And his Jews are called Christians while keeping the law of Moses, the holy Sabbath, and worshipping in their temple at their altars and by their high priests.X. But not to honor him by a too minute examination and exposition, I will sum up the whole of the internal evidences which I deem worthy of remark in the following details:—The book professes to be written at intervals and by different persons during the long period of 1020 years. And yet for uniformity of style, there never was a book more evidently written by one set of fingers, nor more certainly conceived in one cranium since the first book appeared in human language, than this same book. If I could swear to any man’s voice, face, or person, assuming different names, I could swear that this book was written by one man. And as Joseph Smith is a very ignorant man and is called the author on the title page, I cannot doubt for a single moment that he is the sole author and proprietor of it. As a specimen of his style the reader will [93] take the following samples—Page 4th. In his own preface:—“The plates of which hath been spoken.” In the last page, “the plates of which hath been spoken.” In the certificate signed by Cowdery and his two witnesses, he has the same idiom, “which came from the tower of which hath been spoken;” page 16. “we are a descendant of Joseph.” “The virgin which thou seest is the mother of God.” “Behold the Lamb of God the Eternal Father,” p. 25. “Ye are like unto they,” “and I saith unto them,” p. 44. “We did arrive to the promised land;” p. 49. “made mention upon the first plate,” p. 50.Nephi 2400 years ago hears the saying of a Pagan who lived 634 years after him—“The God of nature suffers.” 51. “The righteous need not fear; for it is they which shall not be confounded,” 58. Shakspeare was read by Nephi 2200 years before he was born—“The silent grave from whence no traveller returns,” 61. “Your own eternal welfare” was a phrase then common in America, p. 62. “Salvation is free” was then announced. “That Jesus should rise from the dead” was repeatedly declared on this continent in the reign of Nebuchadnezer. And at the same time it was said, “Messiah cometh in the fulness of time that he might redeem the children of men from the fall,” p. 65. “The fall” was frequently spoken of at the Isthmus of Darien 2400 years ago.I had no object, says Nephi, in the reign of Zedekiah, “but the everlasting salvation of your souls,” 66. “I had spake many things,” “for a more history part are written upon mine other plates,” 69. “Do not anger again because of mine enemies,” p. 70. “For it behoveth the Great Creator that he die for all men.” “It must needs be an infinite atonement.” “This flesh must go to its mother earth.” “And this death must deliver up its dead,” p. 70. were common phrases 2300 years ago—“for the atonement satisfieth the demands of his justice upon all those who have not the law given them,” p. 81. The Calvinists were in America before Nephi. “The Lord remembereth all they,” 85. “The atonement is infinite for all mankind,” p. 104. The Americans knew this on the Columbo 2400 years ago. “His name shall be called Jesus Christ the Son of God.” An angel told this to Nephi 545 years before it was told to Mary, p. 105. “And they shall teach with their learning and deny the Holy Ghost which giveth them utterance:” this prophecy was at that time delivered against us, p. 112. “My words shall hiss forth unto the ends of the earth,” p. 115. “Wherein did the Lamb of God fill all righteousness in being baptized by water,” 118. This question was discussed 2300 years ago. “The baptism by fire and the Holy Ghost was preached in the days of Cyrus,” p. 119. “The only true doctrine of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Ghost which is one God without end. Amen,” p. 120. This was decided in the time of Daniel the Prophet. “I glory in plainness,” says Nephi. “Christ will show you that these are his words in the last day,” p. 122. Too late to prove your mission Mr. Nephi!!“After that ye have obtained a hope in Christ, ye shall obtain riches if you seek them.” So spoke Jacob in the days of Ezekiel the Prophet. “They believed in Christ and worshipped the Father in his name,” p. 129. This was said by Jacob in the time of Daniel. “Do as ye hath hitherto done,” says Mosiah, p. 158. These Smithisms are in every page. “And his mother shall be called Mary,” p. 160. “The Son of God and Father of heaven and earth,” p. 161. “The infant perisheth not, that dieth in his infancy.” “For the natural man is an enemy of God and was from the fall of Adam, and will be for ever and ever,” p. 161. This was spoken by King Benjamin 124 years before Christ. He was a Yankee, too, for he spoke like Smith, saying, “I who ye call your king.” “They saith unto the king,” p. 182. This was another Joseph Smith called Mosiah. “They were baptized in the waters of Mormon, and were called the church of Christ,” p. 192. This happened 100 years before Christ was born. “Alma, why persecuteth thou the church of God,” p. 222. “Ye must be born again; yea, born of God—changed from their carnal and fallen state to a state of [94] righteousness,” 214. This was preached also 100 years before Christ was born. “These things had not ought to be,” 220.“I, Alma, being consecrated by my father Alma to be a high priest over the church of God, he having power and authority from God to do these things, (p. 232) say unto you, except ye repent ye can in no wise enter into the Kingdom of Heaven.” 237. “He ordained priests and elders, by laying on his hands, to watch over the church”—“Not so much as a hair of the head shall be lost in the grave”—“The holy order of the high priesthood.” p.250. The high priesthood of Alma was about 80 years before Christ. “The Lord poured out his spirit to prepare the minds of the people for the preaching of Alma, preaching repentance.” p. 268. Alma was a Yankee of Smith’s school, for he saith: “The light of everlasting light was lit up in his soul.” p. 47.During the pontificate of Alma men prayed thus: “If there is a God, and if thou art God, wilt thou make thyself known unto me.” p. 286. “Alma clapped his hands upon all they which were with him.” p. 313. “Instruments in the hand of God” were the preachers of Alma. p. 323. Modest and orthodox men, truly!! “If ye deny the Holy Ghost when it once hath place in you, and ye know that ye deny, behold this is the unpardonable sin.” p. 332. So Alma preached. “And now, my son, ye are called of God to preach the Gospel.” p. 340. “They were high priests over the church.” p. 350. “The twenty and second year of the judges this came to pass.” p. 364. “They were valiant for courage.” p. 376. These are but as one drop out of a bucket compared with the amount of Smithisms in this book. It is patched up and cemented with “And it came to pass”—“I sayeth unto you”—“Ye saith unto him”—and all the King James’ haths, dids, and doths; in the lowest imitation of the common version; and is, without exaggeration, the meanest book in the English language: but it is a translation made through stone spectacles, in a dark room, and in the hat of the prophet Smith, from the reformed Egyptian!!! It has not one good sentence in it, save the profanation of those sentences quoted form the Oracles of the living God. I would as soon compare a bat to the American eagle, a mouse to a mammoth, or the deformities of a spectre to the beauty of Him whom John saw in Patmos, as to contrast it with a single chapter in all the writings of the Jewish or Christian prophets. It is as certainly Smith’s fabrication as Satan is the father of lies, or darkness the offspring of night. So much for the internal evidences of the Book of Mormon.Its external evidences are, first, the testimony of the prophets Cowdery, Whitmer, and Harris; who saw the plates and heard the voice of God; who are disinterested retailers of the books. I would ask them how they knew that it was God’s voice which they heard—but they would tell me to ask God in faith. That is, I must believe it first, and then ask God if it be true!!’Tis better to take Nephi’s proof, which is promised us in the day of final judgment! They say that spiritual gifts are to be continued to the end of time among the true believers. They are true believers—have they wrought any miracles? They have tried: but their faith failed. Can they shew any spiritual gift? Yes, they can mutter Indian, and traffic in new Bibles.“But Smith is the wonder of the world.” So was the Apocalyptic beast! “an ignorant young man.” That needs no proof. Gulliver’s Travels is a heroic poem in comparison of this book of Smith. “But he cannot write a page.” Neither could Mahomet, who gave forth the Alcoran. “Smith’s an honest looking fellow.” So was Simon Magus, the sorcerer. “But he was inspired.” So was Judas, by Satan.Its external evidences are also the subscriptions of four Whitmers, three Smiths, and one Page, the relatives and connexions of Joseph Smith, junior. And these “men handled as many of the brazen or golden leaves as the said Smith translated.” So did I. But Smith has got the plates of which hath been spoken. Let him shew them. Their certificate proves nothing, save [95] that Smith wrote it, and they signed it. But Smith gives testimony himself. There is one who says: “If I bear testimony of myself, my testimony ought not to be regarded.”If this prophet and his three prophetic witnesses had aught of speciosity about them or their book, we would have examined it and exposed it in a different manner. I have never felt myself so fully authorized to address mortal man in the style in which Paul addressed Elymas the sorcerer as I feel towards this Atheist Smith. His three witnesses, I am credibly informed, on one of their horse-swapping and prophetic excursions in the Sandusky country, having bartered horses three times for once preaching, represented Walter Scott and myself as employed in translating these plates, and as believers in the book of Mormon. If there was any thing plausible about Smith, I would say to those who believe him to be a prophet, hear the question which Moses put into the mouth of the Jews, and his answer to it—“And if thou say in thy heart, How shall we know the word which the Lord hath not spoken?”—Does he answer, “Ask the Lord and he will tell you”?—Does he say “Wait till the Day of Judgment and you will know”? Nay, indeed; but—“When a prophet speaketh in the name of the Lord, if the thing follow not, nor come to pass, that is the thing which the Lord hath not spoken; the prophet hath spoken it presumptuously: thou shalt not be afraid of him.” Deut. 18. 8. Smith has failed in every instance to verify one of his own sayings. Again, I would say in the words of the Lord by Isaiah, “Bring forth your strong reasons, saith the King of Jacob: let them bring them forth and shew us what shall happen: let them shew the former things what they mean, that we may consider them, and know the latter end of them—shew the things which are to come hereafter, that we may know that you are prophets: yea, do good or do evil, that we may be dismayed and behold it together. Behold you are nothing, and your work of naught: an abomination is every one that chooseth you.” Is. 41. 21–23.Let the children of Mormon ponder well, if yet reason remains with them, the following passage from Isaiah 44, and if they cannot see the analogy between themselves and the sons of ancient imposture, then reason is of as little use to them as it was to those of whom the prophet spake—“The carpenters having chosen a piece of wood framed it by rule and glued the parts together, and made it in the form of a man and with the comeliness of a man, to set it in a house. He cut wood from the forest which the Lord planted—a pine tree, which the rain had nourished, that it might be fuel for the use of man: and having taken some of it he warmed himself; and with other pieces they made a fire and baked cakes, and of the residue they made gods and worshipped them. Did he not burn half of it in the fire, and, with the coals of that half, bake cakes; and having roasted meat with it did he not eat and was satisfied; and when warmed say, “Aha! I am warmed, I have enjoyed the fire”? Yet of the residue he made a carved god, and worshippeth it, and prayeth to it, saying, “Deliver me, for thou art my God.”“They had not sense to think; for they were so involved in darkness that they could not see with their eyes, nor understand with their hearts: nor did any reason in his mind. nor by his understanding recollect, that he had burned half of it in the fire, and on the coals thereof baked cakes, and had roasted flesh and eaten, and of the residue had made an abomination; so they bow themselves down to it. Know thou that their heart is ashes, and they are led astray and none can deliver his soul. Take a view of it, will you not say, “There is indeed a lie in my right hand”?“Remember these things, O Jacob, even thou Israel, for thou art my servant. I have made thee my servant; therefore O Israel do not thou forget me. For, lo! I have made thy transgressions vanish like a cloud—and thy sins like the murky vapor. Return to me and I will redeem thee.” A. CAMPBELL. February 10, 1831.
GOLD BIBLE, NO. 4.Since we have had any knowledge of the habits or propensities of the human species, we find that man has been prone to absurdities; and it too often happens that while we carefully attempt to detect them in others, we fondly cherish some gross inconsistencies within our own bosoms. The lust of power, doubtless stimulates the few, while ignorance binds the many, like passive slaves to the car of superstition.It is passing strange, that in all ages of the world, gross stupidity in an impostor should be considered among the vulgar, irrefragible proof of his divine mission, and the most bungling piece of legerdemain, will receive from them all the credit of a well attested miracle.Joanna Southcote published a book in the city of London,in 1804, in which her first prophecies were detailed.—She declares that she did not understand the communications given her by the spirit, till they were afterwards explained to her. The spirit informed her how she could foretel the weather and other events. She declares that the death of Bishop Buller, was foretold in her a dream. One night she heard an iron ball roll three steps down stairs, which the spirit told her was a sign of three great evils, about to fall upon the land—the swords, the plague, and famine. She relates that she foretold the extraordinary harvest, which happened in 1800. She was often ordered to read the bible, when the spirit would interpret its meaning. She informs her readers, that Jacob’s warning to his sons, is applicable to our times—mentions frequent contests with various preachers, and talks much about the marriage of the Lamb.The following is from one of her communications, “As wrong as they are in saying thou hast children bro’t [100] up by the parish, and thou art Bonaparte’s brother, and that thou hast been in prison; so false is their sayings, thy writings come from the devil, or any spirit but the spirit of the LIVING GOD; and that every soul in this nation shall know before the FIVE YEARS I mentioned to the people in 1800 are expired, and then I will return as a DIADEM of beauty to the residence of my people, and they shall praise the GOD OF THEIR SALVATION.In 1805, Joanna published a pamphlet, attempting to confute the “five charges” which had been made against her and published in the newspapers. First, sealing her disciples. Second, on the invasion. Third, on famine. Fourth, her mission, and fifth, her death. Sealing is an important point among these people.—Joanna gives those who profess a belief in her mission, and will subscribe to the things revealed in her “WARNING,” a sealed paper with her signature, by which they are led to think, that they are sealed against the day of redemption, and that all those who possess these seals, would be signally honored by the Mesiah when he should come in the spring (of 1807). Her followers believed her to be the bride, the Lamb’s wife, and that as man fell by a woman, he will be restored by a woman. Many of her followers pretended to have visions and revelations. At present it would appear that both warning, and sealing have subsided; and they are waiting in awful suspense for the commencement of the thousand years reign on earth, when peace will universally prevail. They now pretend that Christ will not come in person, but in spirit, and all the dead who have been sealed, will be raised from their graves, to partake of this happy state.If an imposture, like the one we have so briefly noticed, could spring up in the great metropolis of England, and spread over a considerable portion of that kingdom, it is not surprising that one equally absurd, should have its origin in this neighborhood, where its dupes are not, or ever will be numerous. In the commencement, the imposture of the “book of Mormon,” had no regular plan or features. At a time when the money digging ardor was somewhat abated, the elder Smith declared that his son Jo had seen the spirit, (which he then described as a little old man with a long beard,) and was informed that he (Jo) under certain circumstances, eventually should obtain great treasures, and that in due time he (the spirit) would furnish him (Jo) with a book, which would give an account of the Ancient inhabitants (antideluvians,) of this country, and where they had deposited their subatance, consisting of costly furniture, &c. at the approach of the great deluge, which had ever since that time remained secure in his (the spirits) charge, in large and spacious chambers, in sundry places in this vicinity, and these tidings corresponded precisely with revelations made to, and predictions made by the elder Smith, a number of years before.The time at length arrived, when young Jo was to receive the book from the hand of the spirit, and he repaired accordingly, alone, and in the night time to the woods in the rear of his father’s house (in the town of Manchester about two miles south of this village) and met the spirit as had been appointed. This rogue of a spirit who had bafled all the united efforts of the money diggers, (although they had tried many devices to gain his favor, and at one time sacrificed a barn yard fowl,) intended it would seem to play our prophet a similar trick on this occassion; for no sooner had he delivered the book according to promise, than he made a most desperate attempt, to regain its possession. Our prophet however, like a lad of true metal, stuck to his prize, and attempted to gain his father’s dwelling, which it appears, was near at hand. The father being alarmed at the long absence of his son, and probably fearing some trick of the spirit, having known him for many years; sallied forth in quest of the youthful adventurer. He had not however, proceeded far before he fell in with the object of his kind solicitude who appeared to be in the greatest peril. The spirit had become exasperated at the stubborn conduct of the young prophet, in wishing to keep possession of the book, and out of sheer spite, raised a whirlwind, which was at that particular juncture, throwing trunks and limbs of trees, about their ears, besides the “elfish sprite” had belabored Jo soundly with blows,—had felled him once to the ground, and bruised him severely in the side. The rescue however, was timely, Jo retained his treasure, and returned to the house with his father, much fatigued and injured. This tale in substance, was told at the time the event was said to have happened by both father and son, and is well recollected by many of our citizens. It will be borne in mind that no divine interposition had been dreamed of at this period.
BOOK OF MORMON.— Our Painesville correspondent informs us, that about the first of Nov. last, Oliver Cowdery, (we shall notice this character in the course of our labors,) and three others, arrived at that village with the “New Bible,” on a mission to the notorious Sidney Rigdon, who resides in the adjoining town. Rigdon received them graciously—took the book under advisement, and in a few days declared it to be of “Heavenly Origin.” Rigdon, with about 20 of his flock, were dipt immediately. They then proclaimed that there had been no religion in the world for 1500 years,—that no one had been authorised to preach &c. for that period—that Jo Smith had now received a commission from God for that purpose, and that all such as did not submit to his authority, would speedily be destroyed. The world (except the New Jerusalem) would come to an end in two or three years. The state of New-York would (probably) be sunk. Smith (they affirmed), had seen God frequently and personally—Cowdery and his friends had frequent interviews with angels, and had been directed to locate the site for the New Jerusalem, which they should know, the moment they should “step their feet” upon it. They pretend to heal the sick and work miracles, and had made a number of unsuccessful attempts to do so. The Indians were the ten lost tribes—some of them had already been dipt. From 1 to 200 (whites) had already been in the water,and showed great zeal in this new religion—many were converted before they saw the book. Smith was continually receiving new revelations, and it would probably take him 1000 years to complete them—commissions and paper were exhibited, said to be signed by CHRIST himself!!! Cowdery authorised three persons to preach, &c. and descended the Ohio River. The converts are forming “common stock” families, as most pleasing in the sight of God. They pretend to give the “Holy Spirit,” and under its operations they fall upon the floor—see visions, &c. Indians followed Cowdery daily, and finally saw him enter the promised land, where he placed a pole in the ground, with a light on its top, to designate the siteof the New Jerusalem.
To the Editor of the Telrgraph. THE MORMON CHALLENGE. The following letter was elicited by a public challenge, given by SIDNEY RIGDON on the 30th ulto. in a public meeting held in Kirtland, at which persons from different States were present, in which he defied the world to refute the divine pretensions of the Book of Mormon. The said letter was respectfully presented on the 6th inst. by Nathan P. Goodell, accompanied by Isaac Moore, Esq. both respectable citizens of Kirtland, who informed me, that when he had read about half a dozen lines, till he came to the epithet “infernal,” which he found applied to his beloved book, he committed it to the flames, as Jehoiakim, the pious, meek and lowly King of Judah and Jeremiah’s roll—(Jer 36, 23) Had Mr. R’s boasted humility, meekness and patience not been so quickly exhausted, he would have been duly informed, that the writer meant neither to insult him, nor yet to depreciate his beloved author, more than Christ did the cavillous Jews, when he said to them, “ye are from beneath”—(Jno. 8, 23.) not meaning that they were from hell, as he after explains himself in the following words, “ye are of this world.” Had Mr. R. exercised as much patience as did those proud infidel Jews, he would have learned from my explanation in the very next sentence, that I applied the word infernal to the Book of Mormon, in a just and appropriate sense, according to the claims of the book itself, as being dug up out of the bowels of the earth, or from beneath the bottom of a hill; and, therefore, justly styled infernal, taken in its primary literal sense, as I have explained and applied it in my letter. This however, Mr. R. knows to be the easiest way to get rid of the matter, having no intention to verify his challenge, as he declared to the above named persons before my letter was presented. It also afforded him an opportunity of gratifying his proud resentment by a consequential high-blooded act of indignant retaliation, the most severe that was in his power to inflict; and which, in the mean time, I accept as a just expression of that spirit, which the Book of Mormon is calculated to inspire, and which has been as abundantly expressed in its murderous, scalping inspirations.Without further preface or apology, the letter and the answer are hereby submitted to the public, whose right it is to form their own judgments of the merits of the cause at issue. And although the various topics of argument stated below, and designed to have been urged in the refutation of Mormonism, have not been argued, illustrated, and applied for that purpose, through Mr. R’s failure to make good his empty, boastful challenge, which it appears he has no intention of hazarding, for he fears the light, and therefore cautiously avoids investigation—they, nevertheless, stand as the pillars of Hercules, the insuperable barriers to the feigned pretentions of Mormonism, for the defence of all who do not wilfully and blindly submit to become the dupes of a shameless combination of unprincipled religious swindlers—whose unhallowed design is to rob the simple both of their salvation and their property.THOMAS CAMPBELL.MENTOR, FEB. 4, 1831.Mr. Sidney Rigdon: Dear Sir—It may seem strange, that instead of a confidential and friendly visit, after so long an absence, I should thus address, by letter, one whom, for many years, I have considered not only as a courteous and benevolent friend, but as a beloved brother and fellow laborer in the gospel—but, alas, how changed, how fallen! Nevertheless, I should now have visited you, as formerly, could I conceive that my so doing would answer the important purpose both to ourselves and to the public, to which we both stand pledged from the conspicuous and important stations which we occupy: you, as a professed disciple and public teacher of the infernal book of Mormon; and I, as a professed disciple and public teacher of the supernal book of the Old and New Testaments of our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ—which you now say is superseded by the book of Mormon—is become a dead letter—so dead, that the belief and obedience of it, without the reception of the latter, is no longer available to salvation; to the disproof of this assertion, I understand, you defy the world. I here use the epithets infernal and supernal in their primary literal meaning, the former signifying from beneath, the latter from above, both of which are truly applied, if the respective authors may be accredited; of the latter of which, however, I have no doubt. But, my dear sir, supposing you as sincere in your present, as your former profession, (of the truth and sufficiency of which you have frequently boasted with equal confidence) neither yourself, your friends, nor the world; are therefore bound to consider you as more infallible in your latter than in your former confidence, any further thau you can render good and intelligible reasons for your present certainty. This, I understand from your declaration, on last Lord’s day, you are abundantly prepared and ready to do. I therefore, as in duty bound, accept the challenge, and shall hold myself in readiness, if the Lord permit, to meet you publicly in any place, either in Mentor or Kirtland, or in any of the adjacent towns, that may appear most eligible for the accommodation of the public.The sooner this investigation takes place, the better for all concerned; therefore, it is hoped you will not protract the time beyond what may be justly deemed necessary for giving sufficient publicity to the proposed discussion—say one week after your reception of this proposal to accept the challenge you have publicly given, for the vindication and eviction of the divine authorship of Mormonism, which, if your assertion be true, that there is no salvation for any that do not embrace it; and not only so, but I am credibly imformed you have asserted, that even those who have lived and died in the faith and obedience of the old book, in the triumphant assurance of a glorious resurrection and a blissful immortality, may be in hell for aught you know; therefore, I say again, the sooner this matter is publicly settled, the better. For my part, I do cordially assure you, sir, that if I were in possession of a nostrum, upon the knowledge and belief of which, the salvation of every soul of man depended, I should consider myself responsible to the whole world for the speedy and effectual confirmation and publication of it; and if it be at all a revelation from God for the salvation of men, he must be wonderfully changed since he gave the former revlation of his will for that important purpose, if he do not require you so to do, for he was then willing that all men should come to the knowledge of the truth and be saved; and, therefore, he not only charged all to whom he made it known, by special revelation, to go into all the world and declare it to every creature, but also furnished them with such potent and evincive arguments, both prophetic and miraculous, as no candid inquirer could mistake, without abandoning both his senses and his reason. If then, the book of Mormon, which you assume to vindicate as a divine revelation, upon the belief and obedience of which the salvation of all men stands suspended, be such, then surely the unchanged and unchangeble author, who, it seems, has communicated it to you and others by special revelations, has, doubtless, furnished you with such special, inteiligible, and convincing arguments, as are abundently sufficient to convince every candid inquirer, as he did the heralds of the former dispensations.— Therefore, woe is unto you if you preach not your gospel. But why sould I seem to doubt the philanthropy of my former friend and brother; more than I do my own; or that of the Apostle Paul, that I should thus appear to urge his performance of a challenge, which, no doubt, the purest and most benevolent motives excited him to propose, for the purpose of promoting, as fast as possible, the benign intentions of his mission? Taking this for granted, I shall farther add, in relation to the manner of conducting this all-important investigation, that, seeing it is purely for the discovery and confirmation of the truth, upon the belief and obedience of which, depends the salvation of the world, the parties realizing the deep and awful responsibility of the undertaking, and having no private or personal interest at stake, separate from the rest of mankind, will not only afford each other every facility of investigating and exhibiting the truth by all manner of fairness, both of argument and concession, but also by the mutual allowance of every assistance that can be contributed by the friends on each side, either suggesting matter to the speakers, or by correcting any mistakes that may occur in quotations, references, &c. in an amicable and obliging manner, without giving or taking offence on these accounts; that for these purposes, each party shall be at liberty to select as many of his intelligent friends as he pleases to assist with him as prompters, and if any difficulty occur, respecting time, order, &c. it shall be referred to a competent board of moderators, equally chosen by the parties, that the whole investigation may be conducted without the least shadow of disorder or partiality.According to the spirit and tenor of the above proposals on my part, for the speedy and effectual determination of the momentous question at issue, I shall candidly inform you of the course I intend to take, for the confirmation and defence of my side of the question, that you may be the better prepared to meet my arguments with a sold & unanswerable refutation, if possible; as I can have no wish, nor can any man in this common senses, where the salvation of the soul is at stake, but to know and embrace the saving truth. The proposition that I have assumed, and which I mean to assume and defend against Mormonism, and every other ism that has has been ismed since the commencement of the Christian era, is—The all-sufficiency and the alone-sufficiency of the hole scriptures of the Old and New Testaments, vulgarly call the Bible, to make every intelligent obedient believer wise to salvation, thoroughly furnished for all good works. This proposition clearly and fully established as I believe it most certainly can be, we have no more need for Quakerism, Shakerism, Wilkinsonianism, Buchanism, Mormonism, or any other ism, than we have for three eyes, three ears, three hands, or three feet, in order to see, hear, work, or walk. This proposition I shall illustrate and confirm by showing,1.That the declarations, invitations, and promises of the gospel, go to confer upon the obedient believer the greatest possible privileges, both here and hereafter, that our nature is capable of enjoying.2.That there is not a virtue that can happify or adorn human character, not a vice that can abase on dishappify, which human heart can conceive, or human language can express, that is not most clearly commanded or forbidden in the holy scriptures.3.That there are no greater motives, that can possibly be expressed or conceived, to enforce obedience, or discourage and prevent disobedience, than the scriptures most clearly and unequivocally exhibit.These propositions being proved, every thing is proved that can affect our happiuess, either here or hereafter.We shall, however, if deemed necessary next proceed to expose the blasphemous pretensions of Mormonism, by examining both its external and internal evidences.1.By examining the character of its author and his accomplices, as far as documents for that purpose may have come to hand.2.Their feigned pretensions to miraculous gifts, the gift of tongues, &c.; a specimen of the latter we shall afford them an opportunity of exhibiting in three or four foreign languages.3.We shall next proceed to expose the anti-scriptural assertion, that there has been none duly authorized to administer baptism for the space of fourteen hundred years up to the present time, by showing that the church, or kingdom, of Christ, must have been totally extinct during that period, provided its visible administration had actually ceased during that time, is an express contradiction of the testimony of Jesus, Matt. xvi. 18.4.We are prepared to show that the pretended duty of common property among Christians is anti-scriptural, being subversive of the law of Christ, and inimical to the just rights of human society.5.We shall next proceed to show that re-baptizing believers is making void the ordinance of Christ; and that imposition of hands for communicating the Holy Spirit, is an unscriptural intrusion upon the exclusive prerogative of the primary apostles.6.We shall also show that the pretensions of Mormonism, as far as it has yet been developed, are in no wise superior to the pretensions of the first Quakers, of the French prophets, of the Shakers, of Jemima Wilkinson, &c. That all these pretended to as high degrees of inspiration, to prophecyings, to visions, to as great humility, self denial, devotion to God, moral purity, & spirital perfection; declaimed as much against sin, denounced as heavy judgments against their neighbors, and against the professing world at large, for their corruptions of Christianity, &c. &c. as the Mormonites have done or can do; the two latter have also insisted as much upon the supposed duty of common property, and have spoken as certainly of the near approach of the millennium, and of their relation to that happy state, as any of the Mormonite prophets, especially the Shakers, who pretend to be living subjects of that happy period, and who have also given us an attested record of their miraculous operations.————————————————The obvious conclusion of this sixth argument is evident, that if the Mormonite prophets & teachers can show no better authority for their pretended mission and revelations than those impostors have done, we have no better authority to believe them than we have to believe their predecessors in imposition. But the dilemma is, we can’t believe all for each of them was exclusively right in his day, and those of them that remain are still exclusively right to this day; and if the Shakers be right, the whole world, the Mormonites themselves not excepted, are in the gall of bitterness and bonds of iniquity—quite as far from salvation as you yourself have pronounced all the sectarians on earth to be, namely in a state of absolute damnation.In the last place we shall examine the internal evidence of the Book of Mormon itself, point out some of its evident contradictions, foolish absurdities, shameless pretensions to antiquity, restore it to the rightful claimant, as a production beneath contempt, and utterly unworthy the reception of a schoolboy. Thus, my dear sir, I have given you a fair and full statement of my intended method of defence and attack, of the principal topics of argument pro and con, which I shall use, provided you stand to your proposed challenge. I have also used great plainness of speech, and spoken of things just as I believe they deserve, as you yourself are in the habit of doing; and who can do otherwise upon a subject of such vast importance if he duly realize them? Nevertheless, I would not have you think, although I consider things just as I have spoken, that I suppose myself more infallible than you do yourself; but I should blush to fall short of any one, of any sect whatever, in my expressions of confident certainty of the truth of my profession, which has stood the test of most rigorous investigation for nearly eighteen hundred years, and which I have scrupulously examined for upwards of forty, especially when the investigation is with sectarians of little more than three months standing.But though I have spoken as positively as you have done, and we have both spoken positively enough, I will yet venture to assure you that you will find me as changeable as yourself, provided you afford me evidence paramount to the evidence which I have proposed to produce for the ground I at present occupy, for it has ever been with me a fixed principle, that the less should give way to the greater. But in case I should fail to convince you, or that you should fail to convince me, others may be benefitted: and we shall have the consolation of having discharged our duty both to each other and to the public; for no man liveth to himself.In the mean time I wait for your reply, which you will please forwards per bearer. I hope you will be as candid and plain with me as I have been with you. My best respects to Mrs. Rigdon, and sincerest wish for the happiness of your family.I remain, with grateful remembrance of the past, and best wishes for the future, your sincere friend and humble servant, THOMAS CAMPBELL. 
For the Telegraph. MORMONISM. Forasmuch as many have taken in hand to set in order a declaration of those things which are most surely believed and done among the Mormonites, it seems good to me also (having had knowledge of many things from the beginning) to testify to my brethren of mankind, that they may know something certainly concerning these wonderful people.About the last of October, 1830, four men, claiming to be divinely inspired, came from Manchester and Palmyra, Ontario county, N.Y., bringing a pretended revelation, entitled the “Book of Mormon.” They came to the brethren of the reformation in Mentor, saluted them as brethren, and professed to rejoice at finding a people walking according to the scriptures of truth, and acknowledging no other guide. They professed to have no commands for them, nevertheless, they called upon them to receive their mission and book as from Heaven, which they said chiefly concerned the western Indians, as being an account of their origin, and a prophecy of their final conversion to christianity, and make them a white and delightsome people, and be reinstated in the possession of their lands of which they have been despoiled by the whites.—When called upon for testimony, they appealed (like Mahomet) to the internal evidences of their book. The book was read and pronounced a silly fabrication. When farther pressed upon the subject, they required the brethren to humble themselves before God, and pray for a sign from heaven.They took up their abode with the pastor of the congregation, (Sidney Rigdon,) who read their book and partly condemned it—but, two days afterwards, was heard to confess his conviction of its truth. Immediately the subtlety and duplicity of these men were manifest—as soon as they saw a number disposed to give heed to them, then it was they bethought themselves of making a party—then it was they declared that their book contained a new covenant, to come under which the disciple must be re-immersed. When called upon to answer concerning their pretended covenant, whether it was distinct from that mentioned in Heb. VIII. 10–13. they would equivocate, and would say, (to use their own words) “on the large scale, the covenant is the same, but in some things it is different.” Immediately they made a party—seventeen persons were immersed by them in one night. At this Mr. Rigdon seemed much displeased, and when they came next day to his house, he withstood them to the face—showed them that what they had done was entirely without precedent in the holy scriptures—for they had immersed those persons that they might work miracles as well as come under the said covenant—showed them that the apostles baptized for the remission of sins—but miraculous gifts were conferred by the imposition of hands. But when pressed upon the point, they justified themselves by saying, it was on theirpart merely a compliance with the solicitations of those persons. Mr. Rigdon again called upon them for proof of the truth of their book and mission: they then related the manner in which they obtained faith, which was by praying for a sign, and an angel was shown unto them. Here Mr. Rigdon showed them from the scriptures the possibility of their being deceived: “For Stan himself is transformed into an angel of light”—but said Cowdery, “Do you think if I should go to my Heavenly Father with all sincerity, and pray to him in the name of Jesus Christ, that he would not show me an angel—that he would suffer Satan to deceive me?” Mr. Rigdon replied, “if the heavenly Father has ever promised to show you an angel, to confirm any thing, he would not suffer you to be deceived, for, says the apostle John, ‘this is the confidence we have with him, if we ask things according to his will, he hearkens to us.’ But,” he continued, “if you should ask the heavenly Father to show you an angel when he has never promised you such a thing, if the Devil never had an opportunity of deceiving you before, you give him one now.”However, about two days after, Mr. R. was persuaded to tempt God by asking this sign, which he knew to be contrary to his revealed will; he received a sign, and was convinced that Mormonism was true and divine. Wherefore, to make use of his own reasoning, we presume the Devil appeared to him in the form of an angel of light. The Monday following he was baptized. On the morning of the preceding day he had an appointment to preach in the Methodist chapel at Kirtland. He arose to address the congregation apparently much affected and deeply impressed. He seemed exceedingly humble, confessed the sins of his former life, his great pride, ambition, vainglory, &c. &c. After he was baptized, he professed to be exceedingly joyful, and said he would not be where he was three days ago for the universe. When reminded of the scriptural objection which he had made against praying for that which was not promised, he imputed his reasoning to pride, carnality, and the influence of the evil one. In short, the whole man seemed changed, so much so that Mrs. Rigdon said that Mr. Rigdon’s appearance was enough to convince any one of the truth of their religion. Mr. R. and, indeed the whole of that sect, seem rather disposed to boast of their humility and piety. Mr. R. was formerly very irascible, but now thinks he cannot be ruffled, he was formerly haughty, but now affects great humility. The males among them wear a peculiar kind of hats, by which they distinguish themselves, and exhibit their humility; but while they are calling upon people, as it were, to come and see their humility, we cannot but call to mind an ancient anecdote: when Diogenes the Cynic, saw Plato with a richly embroidered cloak, he caught it from his shoulders, and cast it under his feet, saying “I trampleupon the pride of Plato.”—“Yes,” said Plato, “but with a greater pride.”About three weeks after Mr. R. was baptizee by Oliver Cowdery, he went to the state of New York, to see Joseph Smith, jr. while Cowdery, with his three companions, proceeded on to the western Indians. Before they left us, however, they threw off their mask, and showed their cloven foot. They declared Joseph Smith to be that prophet predicted by Moses, Deut. xviii.15, and applied to O. Cowdery prophetical declarations which are directly and particularly applied to John the Baptist, harbinger of the Messiah. When the apostle Peter and deacon Stephen were brought to confront them upon their application of Deut. xviii.15, they would express wonder, saying, “do you think Christ was like Moses?”Immediately after Mr. R. and the four pretended prophets left Kirtland, a scene of the wildest enthusiasm was exhibited, chiefly, however, among the young people: they would fall, as without strength, roll upon the floor, and, so mad were they that even the females were seen in a cold winter day, lying under the bare canopy of heaven, with no couch or pillow but the fleecy snow. At other times they exhibited all the apish actions imaginable, making grimaces both horid and ridiculous, creeping upon their hands and feet, &c. Sometimes, in these exercises, the young men would rise and play before the people, going through all the Indian manœuvers of knocking down, scalping, ripping open, and taking out the bowels. At other times, they would start and runseveral furlongs, then get upon stumps and preach to imagined congregations, baptize ghosts, &c. At other times they are taken with a fit of jabbering that which they neither understand themselves nor any body else, and this they call speaking foreign languages by divine inspiration. Again the young men are seen running over the hills in pursuit, they say, of balls of fire which they see flying through the air.They say much about working miracles, and pretend to have that power. Cowdery and his fellows essayed to work several while they tarried in Kirtland, one in particular, the circumstances of which I had from the Mormonites themselves. It was a young female who hadbeen confined to her bed for two years—they prayed over her, laying on hands, and commanding her in the name of Jesus Christ to rise up and walk; however, no effect appeared until the next day, when she was persuaded to leave her couch and attempt to walk. She arose, walked three or four steps, (which they told as a miracle) she then almost fainted, and was assisted back to her bed from which she’s not since arisen. But as all their miracles have proved to be a mere sham, to speak vulgarly, the Mormonites have endeavored to save the credit of their prophets, by declaring that they never pronounced these people whole but only prayed for them—but when confronted by one of the disciples in Kirtland upon the instace just mentioned, as it was so public they could not deny it, one of them said that he did not know but Cowdery did command her to arise, but if he did it was in a laughing, jesting way!!!—Another of the Mormonites said Cowdery did not command her to arise, but merely asked her why she did not arise. Another instance of a man in Painesville, who was in the last stage of consumption, was attempted to be healed by Cowdery. A few days afterwards Mr. Rigdon was heard to say “that he would get well, if there was a God in Heaven!” he has since deceased. But these prophets had the policy to cover their retreat in these things, by saying that they would not recover immediately; the Lord would take his own time; and one of these people a few days ago, when put to the worst upon the subject, said that he did not think Cowdery would have attempted to do any miracles, had he have known how things would turn out.Feb.1.—Mr. Rigdon just returned from the state of New York. His irascible temper only left him for a little season. Two friends went from Mentor to see him—required of him a reason for his present hope, and for his belief in the Book of Mormon; he declined, saying he was just weary, having just come off his journey; had lost much sleep, and the like. After a number of words had passed, by way of solicitation on one side, and refusal on the other, one of the friends from Mentor said he thought there was no more evidence to confirm the Book of Mormon than the Koran of Mahomet. At this Mr. Rigdon seemed very angry—rose up and said, “Sir, you have insulted me in my own house—I command silence—If people that come to see us cannot treat us with civility, they may walk out of the door as soon as they please.” The person then made some apology. Mr. R. said he had borne every thing; he had been insulted and trampled upon by old and young; and he would bear it no longer. The other of the friends from Mentor expressed his astonishment, that a man who had just been exhorting others in so meek and humble a manner, as Mr. R. had been doing, a few minutes before, should manifest such a spirit. Mr. R. denied that he was angry. The two friends bade him good night, and departed. Two days after, I accompanied several friends to Mr. R’s residence, we found him in conversation with a Methodist presiding elder—that being soon broken off, one of my friends modestly approached Mr. R. and solicited him to give some reason for his present faith. Mr. R. with great show of good nature, commenced a long detail of his researches after the character of Joseph Smith; he declared that even his enemies had nothing to say against his character; he had brought a transcript from the docket of two magistrates, where Smith had been tried as a disturber of the peace, which testified that he was honorably acquitted. But this was no evidence to us that the Book of Mormon was divine. He then spoke of the supernatural gifts with which he said Smith was endowed: he said he could translate the scriptures from any language in which they were now extant, and could lay his finger on every interpolation in the sacred writings, adding, that he had proved him in all these things. But my friend knowing that Mr. Rigdon had no knowledge of any language but his own vernacular tongue, asked him how he knew these things, to which Mr. R. made no direct reply.Mr. Smith arrived at Kirtland the next day; and being examined concerning his supernatural gifts by a scholar, who was capable of testing his knowledge, he confessed he knew nothing of any language, save the king’s English.Mr. R. asserted that our revelation came to us upon human testimony—this we denied, and gave him reasons which he himself formerly urged against deists. He then said the oldrevelation was confirmed by miracles, but the Book of Mormon would never be; it was not designed to be thus confirmed. (And Mahomet said, nearly twelve centuries ago, “Moses and Jesus were empowered to work miracles, yet the people did not receive them; wherefore God had sent him without that attestation, to be the last and greatest prophet.”) But in this Mr. R. contradicts his book, for that declares it is thus to be established.We then asked Mr. R. what object we could have in receiving the Book of Mormon—whether it enjoined a single virtue that the Bible did not, or whether it mentioned and prohibited a single additional viced, or whether it exhibited a new attribute of Deity? He said it did not. “The Book of Mormon,” said he, “is just calculated to form and govern the millennial church; the old revelation was never calculated for that, nor could it accomplish that object; and without receiving the Book of Mormon, there is no salvation for any one into whose hands it shall come.” He said faith in the Book of Mormon was only to be obtained by asking the Lord concerning it. To this scriptural objections were made. He then said if we had not familiarity enough with our Creator to ask of him a sign, we were no Christians; and, that if God would not condescend to his creatuses, in this way, he was no better than Juggernaut!!!!Now, courteous reader, I have given a simple statement of facts for the purpose that you might not be deceived by the pretensions of these false prophets. They proclaim the ancient gospel, putting their own appendages to it. When they think it will best suit their purpose, they say nothing about the Book of Mormon, and at other times make it their chief topic.—Mr. R. said to me, since he became a Mormonite, that it was no part of his religion to defend the Book of Mormon, he merely wished the people to give heed to the old revelation, to humble themselves, and enter into the privileges which it conferred upon its believing subjects. Again, there is no salvation without receiving the Book of Mormon! Mr. R. now blames Cowdery for attempting to work miracles, and says it was not intended to be confirmed in that way. How then are we to obtain faith? Does the book offer any internal evidence of its divinity? If it does, it has not yet been discovered. It contains nothing but what might have been, and evidently was, borrowed from the sacred writings and from the history of the world. Was it so with the revelation that was from the beginning? far otherwise. A celebrated English writer, (Soam Jenyns) has proved to a demonstration, that the Christian religion is demonstrably divine, irrespective of any miracle that was ever wrought, from these premises, viz: that there were no writings or systems, then in the world, from which it could have been borrowed. Again, respecting Smith and his followers, do they give any proof of their honesty? They can give none but their own assertion; they have no sacrifice to make—no loss of fortune of reputation to sustain—they are in a land of liberty. Very different were the circumstances of those who first promulgated the “faith once delivered to the saints:”—They had to forsake ther relatives, leave their possessions, and forfeit their repution. Scourging and torture, imprisonment and death, were often staring them in the face, and always in the prospective. Thirteen apostles, all, save one, sealed their testimony with their blood. So, whether their religion was true or false, they proved their honesty. But Mormonism is to be proved from beginning to end by assertion, and this we have in whole numbers, without fractions. But we know that they cannot more roundly and positively assert than hundreds of impostors who have gone before them.But we know who has said, “evil men and seducers will wax worse and worse, deceiving and being deceived,” for which cause we are admonished to “continue in the things which we have learned, and been assured of, knowing from whom we have received them.” The Pharisees said to the blind man, who had been healed by Jesus Messiah, “we know that God spoke unto Moses, but as for this fellow we know not whence he is.” So we say; we know that “God has spoken unto us in these last days by his Son,” but as for Joseph Smith we know not whence he is. But we know the scripture has said, “cursed is the man that trusteth in man, and maketh flesh his arm, and whose heart departeth from the Lord; for he shall be like the heath in the desert, and shall not see when good cometh, but shall inhabit the parched places in the wilderness, in a salt land not inhabited.” But the contrast is, “blessed is the man who trusteth in the Lord, and whose hope the Lord is; for he shall be as a tree planted by the waters, that putteth out her root by the river, and shall not see when heat cometh, but her leaf shall be green, and shall not be careful in the year of drought, neither shall cease from yielding fruit.”Now let me conclude with the conclusion of that revelation which begins with the beginning of time and ends with the end of time: “If any man shall add unto these things, God shall add unto him the plagues that are written in this book; and if any man shall take away from the words of the book of this prophecy, God shall take away his part out of the book of life, and out of the holy city, and form the things which are written in this book.”—“And all the people shall say amen.”M. S[.] C
GOLD BIBLE, NO. 5. Every impostor since the creation, has owed his success to the ignorance of the people, and the propensity inherent in their natures, to follow every thing absurd or ridiculous. Learning it is said, flourished in some parts of Arabia, at the time Mahomet made his appearance, and this may sufficiently account for the slow progress that impostor made for the first years of his pretended mission, and had not the Koran been supported by the sword the whole imposition, in all probability, would have died in embryo, and the disciples and followers of the crescent, would never have been able to subjugate the fairest portion of the globe.It is said that Sergius, a christian Monk, assisted Mahomet in writing the Koran, which is allowed by the best and most candid writers, to be written with the utmost elegance and purity, in the language of the Koreishites, the most noble and polite of all the Arabians. Mahomet had a regular plan from the beginning; in the commencement of his imposture, he professed an intimate connexion with the angel Gabriel, and was afterwards allowed, as he declares, numerous conferences with God himself. He was too cunning to attempt many miracles before his followers, and even the story of the tame pigeon, who had been taught to light upon the shoulder of the prophet, and eat millet from his ear, is denied by many Arabian historians.It is well known that Jo Smith never pretended to have any communion with angels, until a long period after the pretended finding of his book, and that the juggling of himself or father, went no further than the pretended faculty of seeing wonders in a “peep stone,” and the occasional interview with the spirit, supposed to have the custody of hidden treasures; and it is also equally well known, that a vagabond fortune-teller by the name of Walters, who then resided in the town of Sodus, and was once committed to the jail of this county for juggling, was the constant companion and bosom friend of these money digging impostors.There remains but little doubt, in the minds of those at all acquainted with these transactions, that Walters, who was sometimes called the conjurer, and was paid three dollars per day for his services by the money diggers in this neighborhood, first suggested to Smith the idea of finding a book. Walters, the better to carry on his own deception with those ignorant & deluded people who employed him, had procured an old copy of Cicero’s Orations, in the latin language, out of which he read long and loud to his credulous hearers, uttering at the same time an unintelligible jargon, which he would afterwards pretend to interpret, and explain, as a record of the former inhabitants of America, and a particular account of the numerous situations where they had deposited their treasures previous to their final extirpation.So far did this impostor carry this diabolical farce, that not long previous to the pretended discovery of the “Book of Mormon,” Walters assembled his nightly band of money diggers in the town of Manchester, at a point designated in his magical book, and drawing a circle around the laborers, with the point of an old rusty sword, and using sundry other incantations, for the purpose of propitiating the spirit, absolutely sacrificed a fowl, (“Rooster,”)in the presence of his awe-stricken companions, to the foul spirit, whom ignorance had created, the guardian of hidden wealth; and after digging until day-light, his deluded employers retired to their several habitations, fatigued and disappointed.If the critical reader will examine the “Book of Mormon,” he will directly perceive, that in many instances, the style of the Bible, from which it is chiefly copied, has been entirely altered for the worse. In many instances it has been copied upwards, without reference to chapter or verse, (taking Jeremiah for an example) and that the old and new Testament, have been promiscuously intermingled, with the simple alteration of names, &c. with some interpolations, which may easily be discovered, by the want of grammatical arrangement.How far Smith, Cowdery, or any of their worthy compeers, were conversant with the writings, or lives of Mahomet and other impostors, will be discussed hereafter.
Mr. Howe — We hear much these days about the Mormonites, the Mormon Bible, the Book of Mormon, and people are very desirous to know what Mormon signifies. In answering their enquiries, I would refer them to Bailey’s Dictionary, where they will find that the word Mormon comes from the Greek word mormoo, and by that author is said to signify, “bugbear, hobgoblin, raw head, andbloody bones.”The above has been furnished us by a correspondent in the country, for which he is entitled to some credit for the discovery. Bailey’s Dictionary is an English work of quite ancient date, and but a very few copies are now extant, and those printed in London, some fifty or sixty years ago. We have, however, seen a copy, and find the above definition correctly stated, as given by that author. It seems, therefore, that the writer of the new bible, intentionally or otherwise, gave the book not only an appropriate, but a classical name. This was no doubt done for the purpose of carrying out his experiment on human credulity to the greatest extent—even to give the book a name, in addition to its contents, which would carry on the very face of it the nature of its true character—a fiction of hobgoblins and bugbears.
We have received a pamphlet of 12 pages, containing a review of the “Book of Mormon,” from the able pen of Alexander Campbell, of Va. It unequivocally and triumphantly sets the question of the divine authenticity of the “Book” forever at rest, to every rational mind. We shall endeavor to lay it before our readers in two or three subsequent numbers.
SOMETHING NEW. — THE GOLDEN BIBLE.The mind of man is ever active. Either in good or in the pursuit of evil, or in the attainment of objects combining both, with all the possible degrees of energy and intelligence it moves, or ceases only momentarily and resuscitates to exert an accelerated and more effective influence. The multiplied departments of human knowledge or speculation afford the channels for the flooding mental operations. Truth and intelligence furnish ample direction and employ for all the ingenuity and labor of man; and the world is beginning to awake to the merits of the observation, as the history of fact and experiment lucidly testify. But in the absence of intelligence, ingenuity is put to the torture for the discovery of other materials and the basest passions are enlisted in the furtherance of projects, the boldest daring and the artful perserverance of which, both are marvellous, but which the more so, is problematical. Of such a cast is the imposition designated by the head of this piece. Who would have thought of meeting advocates of a fresh revelation in the nineteenth century? Judaism contemplated such an event, as a clause in its constitution and the significancy and scope of its observances and prophecies indicate with a distinctness unequivocal, but Christianity never did. Its constitution is perpetual and it is, in its own individuality, the consummation of Divine revelations to mortals. The unobscured and unrestrained vision and glory of man immortalized, succeed the winding up of the administration of the great Philanthropist upon the throne of God and the jurisdiction of his revealing word. Notwithstanding all [217] this, some hundreds of the rabble and a few intelligent citizens of the western part of New York and the eastern part of Ohio, have, with the wildest enthusiasm, embraced a feigned revelation purporting to be literally new. From the advocates of this new religion called Mormonism, from a letter received from the intelligent Post Master at Palmyra, extracts from Mr. Thomas Campbell’s letters and other sources, embracing the subjoined pieces taken from the Telegraph of Painesville, O.: from these different quarters I learn the following particulars. For a long time in the vicinity of Palmyra, there has existed an impression, especially among certain loose classes of society, that treasures of great amount were concealed near the surface of the earth, probably by the Indians, whom they were taught to consider the descendants of the ten lost Israelitish tribes, by the celebrated Jew who a few years since promised to gather Abraham’s sons on Grand Island, thus to be made a Paradise. The ignorance and superstition of these fanatics soon conjured up a ghost, who they said was often seen and to whom was committed the care of the precious deposit. This tradition made money diggers of many who had neither intelligence nor industry sufficient to obtain a more reputable livelihood. But they did not succeed and as the money was not dug up, something must be dug up to make money. The plan was laid, doubtless, by some person behind the curtain, who selected suitable tools. One Joseph Smith, a perfect ignoramus, is to be a great prophet of the Lord, the fabled ghost the angel of his presence, a few of the accomplices the apostles or witnesses of the imposition, and, to fill up the measure of their wickedness and the absurdity of their proceedings, the hidden golden treasure, is to be a golden bible and a new revelation. This golden bible consisted of metallic plates six or seven inches square, of the thickness of tin and resembling gold, the surface of which was covered with hieroglyphic characters, unintelligible to Smith, the finder, who could [218] not read English. However the angel (ghost!) that discovered the plates to him, likewise informed him that he would be inspired to translate the inscriptions without looking at the plates, while an amanuensis would record his infallible reading; all which was accordingly done. But now the book must be published, the translation of the inscriptions which Smith was authorized to show to no man save a few accomplices, who subscribe a certificate of these pretended facts at the end of the volume. Truly a wise arrangement! Among the gang none had real estate save one, who mortgaged his property to secure the printer and binder in Palmyra, but who was so unfortunate as not to be able to convert his wife to the new faith, though he flogged her roundly for that purpose several times. The book, an octavo of from 500 to 1000 pages (for when I saw it I did not notice the number) did not meet ready sale and consequently about 500 copies were sent to the eastern part of this state, which was considered a better market. Though at home it had but little success, the subjoined pieces will show that in the Western Reserve it found better.Here I must devote a moment to another branch of the subject. The Baptist Chronicle of Ky. and similar works, have endeavored to fasten this imposition upon the current reformation, as the doings of Munzer have been fastened upon the Baptists of his own stamp. It and other ungentlemanly insinuations may yet stamp the character of this periodical so as not to subserve the interest of the cause it advocates, or the honor of its conductors. Let all those who would identify Mr. Campbell and those associated with him with this Mormonitish absurdity, know that this new project makes no approach towards the reformation in its character or object, but would indicate a parentage nearer home. Let them know that a prominent Elder, (I mean an aged christian officer) Thomas Campbell, father of the justly celebrated Alexander Campbell, has offered to meet the apostate champion of this un [219] holy imposition and publicly discuss its merits and that the intelligent reformers concur with him; that among the Mormonitish converts are found persons from among all the denominations, Presbyterians, Methodists, and that they are as liable to the charge of having originated the scheme as are the reformers; and indeed, that upon the same ground the Baptist Chroniclers are not unimpeachable. For my own part, sometime since, having met one of these new fangled teachers in a congregation with which neither of us was connected, I refused to occupy the pulpit if he were invited, well knowing that a reformer by so doing would give occasion to misrepresentation. I had no other particular reason for my refusal, unless it was that the man proclaimed another gospel written in another book. The following documents will finish the tale of woe. EDITOR.
MORMONISM.—Our Waterloo correspondent informs us, that two of the most responsible Mormonites, as it respects property, in that vicinity have demurred to the divine command, through Jo Smith, requiring them to sell their property and put it into the common fund, and repair with all convenient speed to the New Jerusalem, lately located by Cowdry somewhere in the western region. A requisition of twelve hundred dollars, in cash, it is said, was made upon one of these gentlemen, (Mr. B.)—“the Lord having need of it.” This request was promptly refused by the gentleman, who, at the same time informed the prophet that he would rather risque [sic] his soul as it was, (having been dipt) than trust his money or property in the hands of such agents as were applying for it.We also learn from the state of Ohio, that the work moves on apace, Jo Smith with his better half, had arrived in that country—the prophet well clad, while the femaleexhibited a gold watch—a profusion of rings, &c.—demonstrating the fact, that even Mormonism is a “living business.” Cowdry had commenced holding private meetings, and eve-droppers had discovered, that scenes were enacted, which could be considered moral, decent or lawful, in none but common [116] stock communities. Dominy Rigdon appears to have burnt a letter from a friend on the subject of the “Gold Bible,” (burning is coming in fashion among the pious.) He blames Cowdry for performing, or attempting to perform miracles—says the world is not yet prepared for them; he has gotten at loggerheads with his old master Campbell, (the same who disputed with Owen at Cincinnati,) and by the best information we can obtain, “Gold Bible” stock is below par even in the state of Ohio.
Martin Harris, another chief of Mormon imposters, arrived here last Saturday from the bible quarry in New-York. He immediately planted himself in the bar-room of the hotel, where he soon commenced reading and explaining the Mormon hoax, and all the dark passages from Genesis to Revelations. He told all about the gold plates, Angels, Spirits, and Jo Smith.—He had seen and handled them all, by the power of God! Curiosity soon drew around thirty or forty spectators, and all who presumed to question his blasphemous pretensions, were pronounced infidels. He was very flippant, talking fast and loud, in order that others could not interpose an opinion counter to his. Every idea that he advanced, he knew to be absolutely true, as he said, by the spirit and power of God. In fine, the bystanders had a fair specimen of the Mormon slang, in this display of one of their head men. The meeting was closed, by a request of the landlord that the prophet should remove his quarters, which he did, after declaring, that all who believed the new bible would see Christ within fifteen years, and all who did not would absolutely be destroyed and dam’d.
GOLD BIBLE, NO. 6.There appears to be a great discrepancy, in the stories told by the famous three witnesses to the God Bible; and these pious reprobates, individually, frequently give different versions of the same transaction. In the first place, it was roundly asserted that the plates on which Mormon wrote his history, (in the reformed Egyptian language) were of gold, and hence its name; gentlemen in this vicinity were called on to estimate its value from its weight, (something more than 20 lbs). Smith and Harris gave out that no mortal save Jo could look upon it and live; and Harris declares, that when he acted as amanuensis, and wrote the translation, as Smith dictated, such was his fear of the Divine displeasure that a screen (sheet) was suspended between the prophet and himself.Whitmar’s description of the Book of Mormon, differs entirely from that given by Harris; both of whom it would seem have been of late permitted, not only to see and handle it, but to examine its contents. Whitmar relates that he was led by Smith into an open field, on his father’s farm near Waterloo, when they found the book lying on the ground; Smith took it up and requested him to examine it, which he did for the space of half an hour or more, when he returned it to Smith, who placed it in its former position, alledging that the book was in the custody of another, intimating that some Divine agent would have it in safe keeping.Thiswitness describes the book as being something like 8 inches square; (our informant did not recollect precisely,) the leaves were plates of metal of a whitish yellow color, and of the thickness of tin plate; the back was secured with three small rings of the same metal, passing through each leaf in succession;—that the leaves were divided equi-distant, between the back & edge, by cutting the plates in two parts, and united again with solder, so that the front might be opened, as it were by a hinge, while the back part remained stationary and immoveable, and in this manner remained to him and the other witnesses a sealed book, which would not be revealed for ages to come, and that even the prophet himself was not as yet permitted to understand. On opening that portion of the book which was not secured by the seals, he discovered incribed on the aforesaid plates, divers and wonderful characters; some of them large and some small,but beyond the wisdom of man to understand without supernatural aid.Some of the other apostles give somewhat similar accounts, but varying in many particulars, according to their various powers of description.—Harris, however, gives the lie to a very important part of Whitmar’s relation, and declares that the leaves or pages of the book are not cut, and a part of them sealed, but that it opens like any other book, from the edge to the back, the rings operating in the place of common binding.As these details, under different modifications, (for it must be borne in mind, that these Mormonites have given versions of the same particulars,) are pretty well understood in this vicinity, we shall give our distant readers, but small portions at a time. We have on hand a new edition of the prophet’s vision, at the time the Gold Bible was revealed to him by the Spirit, and the subsequent transactions, as related by JO’S father and his elder brother;—also sundry money digging scenes in which the Smiths acted conspicuous parts, all of which will be given to the public in due time. The last news from the Mormonites in the West, informs us, that the Rev. [126] Mr. Campbell of the State of Ohio, has given an analysis of the Book of Mormon, in the “Painesville Telegraph,” and is going to examine in divine pretensions. Mr. C. is reputed a man of talents and learning, and the exposition will be interesting to the curious reader. Cowdery is far up the Missouri, converting the Indians.
Our neighbor-in-law, Billy Perkins, says that Mormonism is the Antimasonic religion, because all who have embraced it are antimasons. This is quite a random shot, Billy. But your great eagerness to draw from any source, however filthy, a little help for the handmaid, has probably led you into this error. You appear not to be aware that some “zealous masons” and several “republican jacks,” have beset Jo Smith for “more light.”—And perhaps you have yet to learn that the Mormon bible was printed and sent forth to the world, from a masonic printing office, under a masonic, or some [other injunction, of secrecy. You may also discover a very striking resemblance between masonry and mormonism. Both systems pretend to have a very ancient origin, and to possess some wonderful secrets which the world cannot have without submitting to the prescribed ceremonies, and appropriating a portion or all of their property, as common stock. The secrets of masonry are kept from the world by blasphemous oaths, under a penalty of death—the secrets of mormonism by making the candidate believe that it will be violating the “express command of Heaven,” and the penalty is the eternal displeasure of God, and all “worthy and well qualified” mormons.Billy seems willing to encourage and support any thing that he thinks will be calculated to divert public attention from the iniquitous character of Freemasonry. Mormonism, Billy, will fail in doing it, unless you give it a hoist with your press, which it is rumored you are half inclined to do, as another Bible is in a state of forwardness,for the press.
We have received the following letter from Palmyra, N.Y. on the subject of Bible impostors. It is signed by ten individuals of the first respectibility. Palmyra, March 12, 1831The “gold bible” question excites but little interest in this section of country, its followers being few and generally of the dregs of community, and the most unlettered people that can be found any where, and besides there is much reason to doubt the sincerity of many of them. The first idea of a “Book,” was doubtless suggested to the Smiths by one Walters, a juggling fortune-teller, who made the ignorant believe that an old book in his possession, in the Latin language, comtained an account of the anti-deluvians, &c. and the word was given out that the book Smith was about to find, was a history of hidden treasures. Smith and his father belonged to a gang of money-diggers, who had followed that business for many years, Jo pretending he could see the gold and silver by the aid of what they called a “peep stone.”The book is chiefly garbled from the Old and New Testaments, the Apocraphy having contributed its share: names and phrases have been altered, and in many instances copied upwards.--A quarto Bible now in this village, was borrowed and nearly worn out and defaced by their dirty handling. Some seven or eight of them spent many months in copying, Cowdery being principal scribe. Some of these people will probably go to your state, but few of them are able to live without assistance. Their numbers may be 20 in this vicinity, and but two or three of them own any property to our knowledge. Near Waterloo there is said to be about 40, three or four being men of property. Chamberlain and Burrows, two of the principal ones, it is said have refused to sell, or obey Jo any longer. The truth of it is, Jo overdid his business at the commencement and bore on too hard. The whole gang of these deluded mortals, except a few hypocrites, are profound believers in witchcraft, ghosts, goblins, &c. From the best information we can obtain, the work has entirely stopped in this country, and some [unreadable] been the most ardent are beginning to have misgivings on the subject. Martin Harris the head man here as it respects property, left here a few days ago on a sojourn to your country, having received a special command [unreadable] Cowdery has been heard of far up the [unreadable] pretending to have great success in his [unreadable] but as ignorant as too many of the people [unreadable] is hardly feasible that so clumsy an imposition can spread to any considerable extent. We [unreadable] only to add that the facts published in the “Reflector” are true as far as has come to our knowledge. Yours, &c.
Antimasonic Religion.—The Mormon Bible is Antimasonic, and it is a singular truth that every one of its followers, so far as we are able to ascertain, are antimasons. Now, probably we are to know what is meant by “Church and State.”—Geauga Gazette.The above is from the Gazette of last week. We know of but one other pretence of a like nature, equally ridiculous—and that is, that Masonry is the “Handmaid of Religion.”
The Gold Bible fever seems to be somewhat abating in this vicinity. We have never doubted that reason would in due time resume its empire ove the minds of many, although many may persevere in sustaining the hoax, after they are convinced of the imposition, rather than acknowledge they were duped by so barefaced and contemptible an artifice. Some half a dozen have broken the spell which bound them to the car of their idol, and others being to doubt. One of the imposters, who has been up the Missouri to find the promised land, has returned, after more Mormon books. What must have been his astonishment on finding that Smith and Rigdon had declared Kirtland to be the promised land, while he and others were in ardent pursuit of it near the base of the Rocky Mountains!! It was a “wild goose chase.” The following is from the last number of the Reflector, published near Smith’s quarry.“There appears to be a great discrepancy in the stories told by the famous three witnesses to the Gold Bible; and these pious reprobates, individually, frequently gave different versions of the same transaction. In the first place it was roundly asserted that the plates on which Mormon wrote his history, (in the reformed Egyptain language) were of gold, and hence its name—gentlemen in this vicinity were called on to estimate its value from its weight, (something more than 20 lbs.) Smith and Harris gave out that no mortal save Jo could look upon it and live; and Harris declared, that when he acted as amanuenses, and wrote the translation as Smith dictated, such was his fear of the Divine displeasure, that a screen (sheet) was suspended between the prophet and himself.Whitmar’s description of the Book of Mormon differs entirely from that given by Harris; both of whom it would seem, have been of late permitted, not only to see and handle it, but to examine its contents. Whitmar relates that he was led by Smith into an open field, on his father’s farm near Waterloo, when they found the book lying on the ground; Smith took it up and requested him to examine it, which he did for the space of half an hour or more, when he returned it to Smith, who placed it in its former position, alledging that the book was in the custody of another, intimating that some divine agent would have it in safe keeping. This witness describes the plates as being something like eight inches square, the leaves were plates of metal of a whitish yellow color, and of the thickness of tin plate—the buck was secured with three small rings of the same metal, passing through each leaf in succession; that the leaves were divided equi-distant between the back and edge, by cutting the plates in two parts, and united again with solder, so that the front might be opened, as it were, by a hinge, while the back part remained stationary and immoveable, and in this manner remained to him and the other witnesses a sealed book, which would not be revealed for ages to come, and that even the prophet himself was not as yet permitted to understand. On opening that portion of the book which was not secured by the seals, he discovered inscribed on the aforesaid plates, divers and wonderful characters; some of them large, and some small, but beyond the wisdom of man to understand without supernatural aid.Some of the other apostles give somewhat similar accounts, but varying in many particulars, according to their various powers of description. Harris, however gives the lie to a very important part of Whitmar’s relation, and declares that the layers of pages of the book are not cut, and a part of them sealed,but that it opens like any, other book, from the edge to the back, the rings operating in the place of common binding.As these details, under different modifications, (for it must be borne in mind that these Mormonites have given versions of the same particulars,) are pretty well understood in this vicinity, we shall give our distant readers but small portions at a time. We have on hand a new edition of the prophet’s vision, at the time the gold bible was revealed to him by the spirit, and the subsequent instructions, as related by Jo’s father and his older brother;—also several money digging schemes in which the Smiths noted conspicuous parts, all of which will be given to the public in due time.”
MORMONITES.Messrs. Editors—In the sixth number of your paper I saw a notice of a sect of people called Mormonites; and thinking that a fuller history of their founder, Joseph Smith, jr., might be interesting to community, and particularly to your correspondent in Ohio, where, perhaps, the truth concerning him may be hard to come at, I will take the trouble to make a few remarks on the character of that infamous impostor. For several years preceding the appearance of his book, he was about the country in the character of a glass-looker: pretending, by means of a certain stone, or glass, which he put in a hat, to be able to discover lost goods, hidden treasures, mines of gold and silver, &c. Although he constantly failed in his pretensions, still he had his dupes who put implicit confidence in all his words. In this town, a wealthy farmer, named Josiah Stowell, together with others, spent large sums of money in digging for hidden money, which this Smith pretended he could see, and told them where to dig; but they never found their treasure. At length the public, becoming wearied with the base imposition which he was palming upon the credulity of the ignorant, for the purpose of sponging his living from their earnings, had him arrested as a disorderly person, tried and condemned before a court or Justice. But, considering his youth, (he then being a minor,) and thinking he might reform his conduct, he was designedly allowed to escape. This was four or five years ago. From this time he absented himself from this place, returning only privately, and holding clandestine intercourse with his credulous dupes, for two or three years.It was during this time, and probably by the help of others more skilled in the ways of iniquity than himself, that he formed the blasphemous design of forging a new revelation, which, backed by the terrors on an endless hell, and the testimony of base unprincipled men, he hopedwould frighten the ignorant, and open a field of speculation for the vicious, so that he might secure to himself the scandalous honor of being the founder of a new sect, which might rival, perhaps, the Wilkinsonians, or the French Prophets of the 17th century.During the past Summer he was frequently in this vicinity, and others of the baser sort, as Cowdry, Whitmer, etc., holding meetings, and proselyting a few weak and silly women, and still more silly men, whose minds are shrouded in a mist of ignorance which no ray can penetrate, and whose credulity the utmost absurdity cannot equal.In order to check the progress of delusion, and open the eyes and understandings of those who blindly followed him, and unmask the turpitude and villany of those who knowingly abetted him in his infamous designs; he was again arraigned before a bar of Justice, during last Summer, to answer to a charge of misdemeanor. This trial led to an investigation of his character and conduct, which clearly evinced to the unprejudiced, whence the spirit came which dictated his inspirations. During the trial it was shown that the Book of Mormon was brought to light by the same magic power by which he pretended to tell fortunes, discover hidden treasures, &c. Oliver Cowdry, one of the three witnesses to the book, testified under oath, that said Smith found with the plates, from which he translated his book, two transparent stones, resembling glass, set in silver bows. That by looking through these, he was able to read in English, the formed Egyptian characters, which were engraved on the plates.So much for the gift and power of God. by which Smith says he translate his book. Two transparent stones, undoubtedly of the same properties, and the gift of the same spirit as the one in which he looked to find his neighbor’s goods. It is reported, and probably true, that he commenced his juggling by stealing and hiding property belonging to his neighbors, and when inquiry was made, he would look in his stone, (his gift and power) and tell where it was. Josiah Stowell, a Mormonite, being sworn, testified that he positively knew that said Smith never had lied to, or deceived him, and did not believe he ever tried to deceive any body else. The following questions were then asked him, to which he made the replies annexed.Did Smith ever tell you there was money hid in a certain place which he mentioned? Yes. Did he tell you, you could find it by digging? Yes. Did you dig? Yes. Did you find any money? No. Did he not lie to you then, and deceive you? No! the money was there, but we did not get quite to it! How do you know it was there? Smith said it was! Addison Austin was next called upon, who testified, that at the very same time that Stowell was digging for money, he, Austin, was in company with said Smith alone, and asked him to tell him honestly whether he could see this money or not. Smith hesitated some time, but finally replied, “to be candid, between you and me, I cannot, any more than you or any body else; but any way to get a living.” Here, then, we have his own confession, that he was a vile, dishonest impostor. As regards the testimony of Josiah Stowell, it needs no comment. He swears positively that Smith did not lie to him. So much for a Mormon witness. Paramount to this, in truth and consistency, was the testimony of Joseph Knight, another Mormonite. Newel Knight, son of the former, and also a Mormonite, testified, under oath, that he positively had a devil cast out of himself by the instrumentality of Joseph Smith, jr., and that he saw the devil after it was out, but could not tell how it looked!Those who have joined them in this place, are, without exception, children who are frightened into the measure, or ignorant adults, whose love for the marvellous is equalled by nothing but their entire devotedness to the will of their leader; with a few who are as destitute of virtue and moral honesty, as they are of truth and consistency. As for his book, it is only the counterpart of his money-digging plan. Fearing the penalty of the law, and wishing still to amuse his followers, he fled for safety to the sanctuary of pretended religion.A. W. B.S. Bainbridge, Chen. co., March, 1831.
MORMONITES. — Many of our readers, we suspect, are scarcely aware that a new religion has sprung up in the west, which numbers many hundreds among its professors, and, as far as we can learn from the papers, is on the increase. From the serious and earnest manner in which some of the papers speak of the new religionists, we are almost inclined to think that their editors are really alarmed for the safety of their own faith. Ridiculous as is the idea that the founders of this new religion discovered their Bible inscribed on sheets of gold, which vanished as soon as it was translated, it is not more ridiculous than the stories of the origin of some other books which are now referenced asholy by large portions of this earth’s inhabitants; nor more ridiculous than the idea of a Christian editor, in a Christian country, solemnly writing articles to prove the inauthenticity of the “Golden Bible.”The following is the latest notice we have seen of the Mormonites. One would imagine from its tone, that the editor was trembling in his shoes when he wrote it. It is from the Painesville (Ohio) Gazette:“Last Thursday evening, for the first time, we heard a rigmarole called a Mormon sermon. It was delivered by a ‘teacher’ of the name of Pratt, who has returned from far west. His object was, of course, to establish the divine origin of his book, by showing that the had as good evidence for it as we have for our scriptures. To make out the comparison, he made a lean and jejune attempt to weaken the evidence of the revealed religion, and insisted that they all depended on human testimony, and of no better authority than that by which the Mormon bible is attempted to be established. In short, were it not that he professed to come ‘in the name of the Lord,’ we should have considered his discourse a miserable effort to promulgate infidelity.”By the “far west” mentioned above, we suppose the land of promise is intended, the new country whither the Mormonites are journeying. 
The Mormonites. — Some unworthy and spotted members, according to the western papers, have crept in like grevious wolves among these silly sheep, in the new fold of Mormon, at Painesville, Ohio. The predominance of their preposterous tenents has already made considerable additions to the society. Their location is pleasant—they have “all thing is common”—and it is not surprising that these inducements should bring together a community of vagrants, lovers of idleness, and haters of “the bitter dropping sweat and sweltry pain” of manual labor.“Thither continued pilgrims crowded stillFrom all the roods of earth that pass thereby :For as they chanced to breath on neighboring hillThe freshness of the valley smote their eyeAnd drew them ever and anon more nigh.”Recently, among the accessions to their number, they received a few individuals, who were not only poor in spirit, but in dress; and some men, to the shame-facedness of the sex be it spoken, who entered into the Mormonite communion nearly sans inexpressibles, did, with malice aforethough, appropriate a considerable and amount of corporeal drapery, and straitway, like wolves in sheep’s clothing, made off, leaving their places desolate and void, with the exception of the cast off garments which remained behind.—If the precepts of the new golden bible which the Mormonites have found do not possess more influence than these specemins of conduct would lead us to believe, we think the sect had better dissolve their encampment, melt up the yellow plates into bars, and sell them the first opportunity.—Phil. Gaz.
A new excitement — Mormonism versus Anti-masonry.—An elegant new excitement recently started up, like Jonah’s gourd, in the anti-masonic district of Ohio, which is marching like a giant, and attacking the very citadels of anti-masonry itself. It is called “Mormonism.” It is already making great progress in the Ohio Reserve, and possesses more fanaticism than even anti-masonry itself. We presume Mr. Rush and the American will give us their sentiments on it, as soon as they can cleverly get over the recent Sam Patch plunge into anti-masonry.
Several families, numbering about fifty souls, took up their line of march from this town last week for the “promised land,” among whom was Martin Harris, one of the originalbelievers in the “Book of Mormon.” Mr. Harris was among the early settlers of this town, and has ever borne the character of an honorable and upright man, and an obliging and benevolent neighbor. He had secured to himself by honest industry a respectable fortune—and he has left a large circle of acquaintances and friends to pity his delusion.
Mr. Alexamber Campbell, agreeably to appointment, delivered an eloquent discourse in this village on Friday last, to a large and respectable audience. He occupied about two and a half hours, and his deservedly high reputation as a public speaker was not in the least diminished.—Among the numerous topics introduced, he took occasion to refer to delusions and religious impositions. He did not suppose that God would ever make a new revelation of his will to men, because it would be only to acknowledge that the sending of Christ and his apostles was an abortion, a to’al failure of his designs. He contended that all the revelations which had ever been sent from Heaven, were communicated by men of good repute and credibility—however high or low their stations, whether brought up at the feet of Gamalial, or fishermen, they must sustain a character of honesty among their fellow-men. It was impossible, according to his views of the nature and character of the Supreme Being that he should make known his will by a money-digger, and without giving him any power to make a sure and certain manifestation of his divine appointment.We understand that Mr.Campbell has had an interview with Sidney Rigdon, in relation to the Gold Bible, and that the striking traits of moral depravity were so fully made manifest by the said lieutenant of Jo Smith, that no unprejudiced mind could be mistaken. We are in hopes that the substance of this interview will be given to the public.
The Mormonites. — This infatuated people are again in motion. In their own cant phrase, “they are going to inherit the promise of God to Abraham and his seed.” Their destination is some indefinite spot on the Missouri River, they say about 1500 miles distant. About 30 of them have recently been ordained and some have gone, others are about going, two and two, part by the western rivers and part by land to their distant retreat, far away from the cheering voice of civilized man. Those who have disposed of their property go now, and such as have property, are making market for it so eagerly as often to disregard pecuniary interests, and all are to follow with all Convenient dispatch. They still persist in their powers to work miracles. They say they have often seen them done—the sick are healed—the lame walk—devils are cast out:—and these assertions are made by men heretofore considered rational men, and men of truth.Man is a strange animal—and the lesson before us ought to teach us humility for ourselves, and forbearance towards the opinions of others: for though we are still of opinion that the leaders of this faction are as gross imposters as was Jemima Wilkinson, yet we have no doubt the great body of their followers are sincere and honest.Painesville Gazette.
AUTHENTICITY OF THE GOLDEN BIBLE. Our readers have all no doubt heard of the strange sect that has recently sprung up, to our western country, to wit, of the Mormonites. They have received, so they say and doubtless (many of them) believe, a Golden Book of Revelation from Heaven, in which is recorded [307] “whatever is profitable for doctrine, for reproof, for correction, for instruction in righteousness.” Their numbers already amount to many hundreds, and they seem enthusiastically devoted to their new creed. Here is the last paragraph I have noticed regarding them: From the Painesville (Ohio) Gazette.THE MORMONITES.This infatuated people are again in motion. In their own cant phrase, “they are going to inherit the promise of God to Abraham and his seed.” Their destination is some indefinite spot on the Missouri river, they say about 1500 miles distant.—About 80 of them have recently been ordained, and some have gone, others are about going, two and two, part by the western rivers, and part by land, to their distant retreat, far away from the cheering voice of civilised man. Those who have disposed of their property go now, and such as have property, are making market for it so eagerly as often to disregard pecuniary interests, and all are to follow with all convenient dispatch.  They still persist in the power to work miracles.  They say they often have seen them done—the sick are healed—the lame walk—devils are cast out—and these assertions are made by men heretofore considered rational, and men of truth.Man is a strange animal—and the lesson before us ought to tech us humility for ourselves, and forbearance towards the opinions of others; for though we are still of the opinion that the leaders of this faction are as gross imposters as was Jemima Wilkinson, yet we have no doubt the great body of their followers are sincere and honest.Man is a strange animal, and the lesson before us may teach is more than humility and forbearance. It may teach us incredulity in all marvels and mysteries.How often do we hear such arguments as the following urged as unanswerable in proof of the divine origin of Christianity: “Is it credible that men should imagine they had miraculous power, and should be capable of persuading their fellow-creatures of that, which, if an untruth at all, was so palpable an one? The primitive Christians could neither be deceivers nor deceived. If deceivers, would they have voluntarily and cheerfully endured reproach and loss? As eye-witnesses, and actors on the stage itself, could they be deceived.”Apply the argument to the above case of the Mormonites; and it will go to prove that their golden Bible was writ by the finger of the Almighty, and their miracles performed by his divine interposition.R. D. O.
Mormonites. — These fanatical and deluded beings, who are settling en masse, in the northern part of this state, it would appear from the numbers taken of them by the editors in the neighborhood of their new settlement, are still increasing in numbers; thirty or forty families from the state of New-York, and others from different parts of the union have lately arrived, and professed the doctrine of Mormonism.As we have not, heretofore, referred to this society, we will give the outlines of their new book, which they say is a revelation from Heaven—the “Golden Bible”—the “Book of Mormon,” to use their own language, “written in letters of gold, and sent from Heaven, to their inspired prophet, Joseph Smith.” They have enlisted in their cause respectable and intelligent men, among the numbers, ministers of the gospel, of different persuasions. They refuse all medical aid, and many have already fell victims to their incredulity, but they are unwavering in their belief, and are to hold a meeting, or rather a Jubilee in this month, when many miraculous fetes are to be performed; among others that of raising the dead; and they expect shortly to have several miraculous arths among them. Then location is in Geauga County. Upwards of four hundred citizens, of that county, have, thus degraded themselves, by becoming followers of this false prophet.Jef. Dem.
MORMONISM. Most of our readers must recollect that certain knaves, pretending to have found some holy writings hidden under a stone in Ontario county, New York, started a new religion! The leaders make bold pretensions and assert a gift to work miracles. The members of this sect are now said to amount to 1,000 souls!—some of whom, very honestly, no doubt, believe in all things that are told them, and yet have borne the character of worthy men. Their great prophet Jo, has selected a part of Geauga county, Ohio, and pronounced it to be “the promised land,” and thither the deluded people are flocking, chiefly from New York. As a few men of property have been induced to cast their funds into a common stock, there is no want of recruits from among the lazy and the worthless classes of society. They say that a miracle was worked in their behalf, by clearing a passage through the ice at Buffalo—some of them affect a power even to raise the dead, and perchance, (such is the weakness of human nature), really believe that they can do it! The chiefs of those people appear to exempt themselves from labor, and herein is, probably, the grand object for which they have established this new religion.

BR. BELL: The following is an extract of a letter written by a person in the town of Hiram, State of Ohio, to his brother in Vermont; you are at liberty to publish it or any part thereof.July 1, 1831.“Doubtless you have heard of the Golden Bible or book of Mormon, which was said to be found in Manchester, N. Y. Joseph Smith is the author and proprietor of the book. He says it is a special revelation from God; delivered to him by God’s holy angel—he assumes the character of one of God’s greatest prophets. He got all the followers he could in his own vicinity, and then pretended to heave a call to move on westward, and accordingly made a stand in Cauga county, in and about the town of Mentor Ohio, which he predicted was the new Jerusalem they were in pursuit of. There he got some hundreds of followers, among which was one Elder Rigdon, a Campbellite preacher. Several people went from here out of curiosity to see them; they were deluded by the prophet Jo, and became dupes to one of the greatest impositions ever practiced among mankind. Finally Jo Smith, and several inferior prophets come to Hiram and Nelson, where they have succeeded in making proselytes to the amount of one hundred, among which are the two Priests & Booth—Carnot Mason, Rider and all the Pitkin family from Hartford Vermont. John Johnson, and all his family from Pomfret Vt. Charles Raymond, Aruna & John Tilden, S. R. Parker, T. Brace, all the Hewlits, ten or fifteen in number, P. Alleyn & family, and all the fools in this Country. The prophet Jo has had a new revelation, in which he says God has told him and his followers, that the land of promise is on the Missouri, about 1200 miles to the west of this place, therefore they all want to sell out here as soon as they can, which makes it an excellent chance to buy farms. Twenty eight apostles have started on a mission up the Missouri, among the heathen which they say are the lost tribes of Israel, which God is about to restore. They think the millennium is about to take place, and believe that all those who join the Mormonites and follow the prophet Jo will live a thousand years, and finally never die; but all who do not join them will be destroyed from the face of the earth in the course of two or three years. They pretend to work miracles, and give the gift of the holy spirit, heal the sick, open the eyes of the blind &c. And yet their followers are so full in the faith they do not detect their impositions. John Johnson and his wife have started on a mission to Vermont, to warn their friends in that country to flee from the wrath to come. I think, however, he will not make much by preaching mormonism in that country. I could sit and write about the mormonites all day, but I think I have wrote enough on that subject; and I presume you will consider it hardly worth reading; but it is disgusting to see what damnable work they do make under the garb of religion. I sometimes think I could never hear the word religion or priest.”
Mormonism is spreading faster than anti-masonry ever did, and what is rather remarkable, it is espoused by similar minds. The leaders know better, and so do those of anti-masonry. There is also a similarity in the policy of these two extraordinary sects. The Mormonites denounce those who refuse to join them, and so do the anti-masons.—The only material difference between them is, that the former are seeking money, while the latter care more for office. A man by the name of Davidson has been for some time preaching the Mormon faith in the vicinity of Burlington, Vt. and has already gained quite a number of proselytes in that neighborhood. He professes to be a disciple of one Dilks. of Ohio, and pretends that Dilks has Almighty power, and is equal with God himself! Anti-masons, equally blasphemous, have pretended that “anti-masonry sprung from the throne of God.” This Davidson is represented as wearing his hair long, and professing a great deal of piety. “He preaches that Jesus Christ is a woman and quite inferior to Dilks—that the millennium will take place in 1832.—Philadelphia is the place designated where Dilks is to assemble his followers, and then the rest of mankind are to be swept from the face of the earth, and Dilks and his followers are to inherit their possessions.—The proceedings of this Davidson and the society which he has been enabled to draw around him, who adopt his views, are represented as disgraceful and indecorous to the last degree.” It would be extraordinary indeed, if anti-masonry should be outdone in this particular by Mormonism.
MORMONISM — RELIGIOUS FANATICISM — CHURCH AND STATE PARTY.CANANDAIGUA, Aug. 15th, 1831. New York has been celebrated for her parties—her sects—her explosions—her curiosities of human character—her fanaticism political and religious. The strangest parties and the wildest opinions originate among us. The human mind in our rich vales—on our sunny hills—in our crowded cities or thousand villages—or along the shores of our translucent lakes bursts beyond all ordinary trammels; throws aside with equal fastiduousness the maxims of ages and the discipline of generations, and strikes out new paths for itself. In politics—in religion—in all the great concerns of man, New York has a character peculiarly her own; strikingly original, purely American—energetic and wild to the very farthest boundaries of imagination. The centre of the state is quiet comparatively, and grave to a degree; but its two extremities, Eastern and Western; the city of the Atlantic, and the continuous villages of Lakes, contain all that is curious in human character—daring in conception—wild in invention, and singular in practical good sense as well as in solemn foolery.You have heard of MORMONISM—who has not? Paragraph has followed paragraph in the newspapers, recounting the movements, detailing their opinions and surprising distant readers with the traits of a singularly new religious sect which had its origin in this state. Mormonism is the latest device of roguery, ingenuity, ignorance and religious excitement combined, and acting on materials prepared by those who ought to know better. It is one of the mental exhalations of Western New York.The individuals who gave birth to this species of fanaticism are very simple personages, and not known until this thrust them into notice. They are the old and young Joe Smith’s, Harris a farmer, Ringdon a sort of preacher on general religion from Ohio, together with several other persons equally infatuated, cunning, and hypocritic. The first of these persons, Smith, resided on the borders of Wayne andOntario counties on the road leading from Canandaigua to Palmyra. Old Joe Smith had been a country pedlar in his younger days, and possessed all the shrewdness, cunning, and small intrigue which are generally and justly attributed to that description of persons. He was a great story teller, full of anecdotes picked up in his peregrinations—and possessed a tongue as smooth as oil and as quick as lightening. He had been quite a speculator in a small way in his younger days, but had been more fortunate in picking up materials for his tongue than stuff for the purse. Of late years he picked up his living somewhere in the town of Manchester by following a branch of the “American System”—the manufacture of gingerbread and such like domestic wares. In this article he was a considerable speculator, having on hand during a fall of price no less than two baskets [full], and I believe his son Joe, Junr., was at times a partner in the concern. What their dividends were I could not learn, but they used considerable molasses, and were against the duty on that article. Young Joe, who afterwards figured so largely in the Mormon religion, was at that period a careless, indolent, idle, and shiftless fellow. He hung round the villages and strolled around the taverns without any end or aim—without any positive defect or as little merit in his character. He was rather a stout able bodied fellow, and might have made a good living in such a country as this where any one who is willing to work, can soon get on in world. He was however, the son of a speculative Yankee pedlar, and was brought up to live by his wits. Harris also one of the fathers of Mormonism was a substantial farmer near Palmyra—full of passages of the scriptures—rather wild and flighty in his talk occasionally—but holding a very respectable character in his neighborhood for sobriety, sense and hard working.A few years ago the Smith’s and others who were influenced by their notions, caught an idea that money was hid in several of the hills which give variety to the country between the Canandaigua Lake and Palmyra on the Erie Canal. Old Smith had in his peddling excursions picked up many stories of men getting rich in New England by digging in certain places and stumbling upon chests of money. The fellow excited the imagination of his few auditors, and made them all anxious to lay hold of the bilk axe and the shovel. As yet no fanatical or religious character had been assumed by the Smith’s. They exhibited the simple and ordinary desire of getting rich by some short cut if possible. With this view the Smith’s and their associates commenced digging, in the numerous hills which diversify the face of the country in the town of Manchester. The sensible country people paid slight attention to them at first. They knew them to be a thriftless set, more addicted to exerting their wits than their industry,readier at inventing stories and tales than attending church or engaging in any industrious trade. On the sides & in the slopes of several of these hills, these excavations are still to be seen. They would occasionally conceal their purposes, and at other times reveal them by such snatches as might excite curiosity. They dug these holes by day, and at night talked and dreamed over the countless riches they should enjoy, if they could only hit upon an iron chest full of dollars. In excavating the grounds, they began by taking up the green and in the form of a circle of six feet in diameter—then would continue to dig to the depth of ten, twenty, and sometimes thirty feet. At last some person who joined them spoke of a person in Ohio near Painesville, who had a particular felicity in finding out the spots of ground where money is hid and riches obtained. He related long stories how this person had been along shore in the east—how he had much experience in the money digging—how he dreamt of the very spots where it could be found. “Can we get that man here?” asked the enthusiastic Smiths. “Why,” said the other, “I guess as how we could by going for him.” “How far off?” “I guess some two hundred miles—I would go for him myself but I want a little change to bear my expenses.” To work the money-digging crew went to get some money to pay the expenses of bringing on a man who could dream out the exact and particular spots where money in iron chests was hid under ground. Old Smith returned to his gingerbread factory—young Smith to his financing faculties, and after some time, by hook or by crook,they contrived to scrape together a little “change” sufficient to fetch on the money dreamer from Ohio.After the lapse of some weeks the expedition was completed, and the famous Ohio man made his appearance among them. This recruit was the most cunning, intelligent, and odd of the whole. He had been a preacher of almost every religion—a teacher of all sorts of morals.—He was perfectly au fait with every species of prejudice, folly or fanaticism, which governs the mass of enthusiasts. In the course of his experience, he had attended all sorts of camp-meetings, prayer meetings, anxious meetings, and revival meetings. He knew every turn of human mind in relation to these matters. He had a superior knowledge of human nature, considerable talent, great plausibility, and knew how to work the passions as exactly as a Cape Cod sailor knows how to work a whale ship. His name I believe is Henry Rangdon or Ringdon, or some such word. About the time that this person appeared among them, a splendid excavation was begun in a long narrow hill, between Manchester and Palmyra. This hill has since been called by some, the Golden Bible Hill. The road from Canandaigua to Palmyra runs along its western base. At the northern extremity the hill is quite abrupt and narrow. It runs to the south for a half mile and then spreads out into a piece of broad table land, covered with beautiful orchards and wheat fields. On the east, the Canandaigua outlet runs past it on its way to the beautiful village of Vienna in Phelps. It is profusely covered to the top with Beach, Maple, and White-wood—the northern extremity is quite bare of trees. In the face of this hill, the money diggers renewed their work with fresh ardour, Ringdon partly uniting them in their operations.
THE MORMON DELUSION.“A Presbyterian” residing in Chester, Geauga Co. Ohio, in a letter to the editor of the Hampshire Gazette, communicates the following information respecting the Mormonites, a new sect which has sprung up in the West.“I noticed a few weeks since in your paper a brief account of a sect or gang, who in this vicinity are called Mormonites.—The public mind is awake in this region; go where we will we hear little except Mormonism. I presume there are not less than 5 or 600 of these deluded beings in the towns north and west of this. They have in the worn north of this, what is called the “bag family,” where no one says that aught of the things that he possesses is his own; they have all things common.There are many who were once respectable and intelligent, who are now following these wretched impostors—these pretended prophets. Joseph Smith, Jr, author of the new revelation, is now head man in the bag family. He pretends that he goes to the Lord occasionally for advice, and they think, yea they know they have all their orders from head quarters, even from the Lord Almighty, through the mouth of his prophet. Jo pretends to cast out Devils, to give the Holy Ghost by laying on of hands, to heal the sick, &c.—He has 10 year’s translating to do; he looks in a small stone he has, and there reads the will of the Lord and writes it for the good of his fellow men; he can read a person’s heart by looking in his face.—Some lie in transes a day or two, and visit the unknown regions in the mean time; some are taken with a fit of terrible shaking, which they say is the power of the Holy Ghost. I attended one of their meetings about two weeks ago; a woman was taken shaking who was not a Mormonite, and she has shook the greater part of the time since; she is not inclined to join them yet—says she feels not different in her mind from when she did before. Who would believe me if I should tell you that many Methodists, and ministers, and some Baptists and Presbyterians have joined them? Such is the fact; yes sir, they have been down through the ice in the mill pond, and their sins are all washed away, and they are clothed with selfrighteousness as with a garment. One half has not been told, but I must close.To the above, the editor of the Vermont Chronicle adds:“Our readers will recollect a similar delusion which raged some ten years ago, in the case of the “Pilgrims.” Their Prophet—Old Isaac, as he was called—came from Canada with a few, and encamped in Woodstock. Here outraging not christianity only but humanity, by their absurd opinions and absurder practice—by taking the assertions of their infatuated leader for divine revelation by rolling in the ashes, by making wry faces, and by other unmeaning mummery—they induced many decent people, who should have known better, to join them, under the empty promise of being led to the holy land. Taking a south-west direction they floated along down the Ohio and Mississippi, their number augmenting, till they reached the mouth of the Arkansaw. Here in the swampy delta of the river, they encamped,when in a short time a pestilence carried off two-thirds of their number. The rest becoming urgent for the fulfillment of the Prophet’s promise, he led them a little farther and set his staff in the ground at evening, saying, that there was the promised land, and that in the morning, for proof, they would find the staff had put forth bud and blossom. But behold, in the morning they dry staff remained, and the Prophet had vanished, and with him the purse which contained the representative of their boasted community of property, together with all their pleasing hopes and dreamy visions.From the resemblances between the Pilgrims and the Mormonites in manners and pretensions, we would think Old Isaac had reappeared in the person of Joe Smith, and was intending to make another speculation.”
MORMON RELIGION—CLERICAL AMBITION — WESTERN NEW YORK. — THE MORMONITES GONE TO OHIO. Concluded from yesterday’s paper. About this time a very considerable religious excitement came over New York in the shape of a revival. It was also about the same period, that a powerful and concerted effort was made by a class of religionists, to stop the mails on Sunday—to give a sectarian character to Temperance and other societies—to keep up the Pioneer lines of stages and canal boats, and to organise generally a religious party, that would act altogether in every public and private concern of life. The greatest efforts were making by the ambition, tact, skill and influence of certain of the clergy, and other lay persons, to regulate and control the public mind—to check all its natural and buoyant impulses—to repress effectually freedom of opinion—and to turn the tide of public sentiment entirely in favor of blending religious and worldly concerns together. Western New York has for years, had a most powerful and ambitious religious party of zealots, and their dupes. They have endeavored ever since the first settlement of Rochester, to organize a religious hierarchy, which would regulate the pursuits, the pleasures, and the very thoughts of social life. This organization was kept up by banding churches and congregations together—by instituting laws similar to those of excommunication—by a species of espionage, as powerful and as terrible as that of a Spanish Inquisition. Every occupation in life—every custom of the people—every feeling and every thought, from the running of a stage or of a lady’s tongue up to the legislation of the state, or of Congress, was to be regularly marked and numbered like so many boxes of contraband or lawful merchandise, by these self-created religious censorships and divines. Rochester is, and was the great headquarters of the religious empire. The late Mr. Bissell, one of the most original and talented men in matters in business, was equally so in religious enthusiasm, and all measures calculated to spread it among the people.—The singular character of the people of western New-York—their originality, activity, and proneness to excitement furnished admirable materials for enthusiasts in religion or roguery to work upon. Pure religion—the religion of the heart and conduct—the religion that makes men better and wiser—that makes woman more amiable and benevolent—that purifies the soul—that represses ambition—that seeks the private oratory and not the highway to pour forth its aspirations: such a religion was not that of the party of which I speak. Theirs is the religion of the pomp and circumstance of glorious controversy—the artificial religion of tracts. Magdalen Reports, lines of stages—the religion of collecting money from those who should first pay their debts—of sending out missionaries to spend it, and of letting the poor and ignorant at home starve and die. Such mistaken principles and erroneous views must when attempted to be carried into effect, breed strange results. Men’s minds in this age will not submit to the control of hypocrisy or superstition or clerical ambition. They may be shackled for a day through their wives and daughters—for a month—a year, but it cannot be lasting; when the first die or the last get husbands, independence will be asserted.This general impulse given to religious fanaticism by a set of men in Western New York, has been productive among other strange results of the infatuation of Mormonism. This piece of roguery, folly and frenzy (for it partakes of all) is the genuine fruit of the same seeds which produced the Sunday Mail movement—the Pioneer line of stages—the Magdalen Reports &c. &c. It is religion run into madness by zealots and hypocrites.It was during this state of public feeling in which the money diggers of Ontario county, by the suggestions of the Ex-Preacher from Ohio, thought of turning their digging concern into a religious plot, and thereby have a better chance of working upon the credulity and ignorance of their associates and the neighborhood. Money and a good living might be got in this way. It was given out that visions had appeared to Joe Smith—that a set of golden plates on which was engraved the “Book of Mormon,” enclosed in an iron chest, was deposited somewhere in the hill I have mentioned. People laughed at the first intimation of the story, but the Smiths and Rangdon persisted in its truth. They began also to talk very seriously, to quote scripture, to read the bible, to be contemplative, and to assume that grave studied character, which so easily imposes on ignorant and superstitious people. Hints were given out that young Joe Smith was the chosen one of God to reveal this new mystery to the world; and Joe from being an idle young fellow, lounging about the villages, jumped up into a very grave parsonlike man; who felt he had on his shoulders the salvation of the world, besides a respectable looking sort of a blackcoat. Old Joe, the ex-preacher, and several others, were the believers of the new faith, which they admitted was an improvement in christianity, foretold word for word in the bible. They treated their own invention with the utmost religious respect. By the special interposition of God, the golden plates, on which was engraved the Book of Mormon, and other works, had been buried for ages in the hill by a wandering tribe of the children of Israel, who had found their way to western New York, before the birth of christianity itself. Joe Smith is discovered to be the second Messiah who was to reveal this word to the world and to reform it anew.In relation to the finding of the plates and the taking the engraving, a number of ridiculous stories are told.—Some unsanctified fellow looked out the other side of the hill. They had to follow it with humility and found it embedded beneath a beautiful grove of maples. Smith’s wife, who had a little of the curiosity of her sex, peeped into the large chest in which he kept the engravings taken from the golden plates, and straightway one half the new Bible vanished, and has not been recovered to this day. Such were the effects of the unbelievers on the sacred treasure. There is no doubt but the ex-parson from Ohio is the author of the book which was recently printed and published in Palmyra, and passes for the new Bible. It is full of strange narratives—in the style of the scriptures, and bearing on its face the marks of some ingenuity, and familiar acquaintance with the Bible. It is probable that Joe Smith is well acquainted with the trick, but Harris the farmer and the recent coverts, are true believers.—Harris was the first man who gave credit to the story of Smith and the ex-preacher. He was their maiden convert—the Ali of the Ontario Mahomet, who believed without a reason and without a murmur. They attempted to get the Book printed, but could not raise the means till Harris stept forward, and raised money on his farm for that purpose. Harris with several manuscripts in his pocket, went to the city of New York, and called upon one of the Professors of Columbia College for the purpose of shewing them to him. Harris says that the Professor thought them very curious, but admitted that he could not decypher them. Said he to Harris, “Mr. Harris you had better go to the celebrated Doct. Mitchell and shew them to him. He is very learned in these ancient languages, and I have no doubt will be able to give you some satisfaction.” “Where does he live,” asked Harris. He was told, and off he posted with the engravings from the Golden Plates to submit to Doc. Mitchell.—Harris says that the Doctor received them very “purlitely,” looked at his engravings—made a learned dissertation on them—compared them with the hieroglyphics discovered by Champollion of Egypt—and set them down as the language of a people formerly in existence in the East, but now no more.The object of his going to the city to get the “Book of Mormon” printed, was not however accomplished. He returned with his manuscript or engravings to Palmyra—tried to raise money by mortgage on his farm from the New York Trust Company—did raise the money, but from what source—whether the Trust Company or not I am uncertain. At last a printer in Palmyra undertook to print the translations of Joe Smith, Harris becoming responsible for the expense. They were called translations, but in fact and in truth they are believed to be the work of the Ex-Preacher from Ohio, who stood in the back ground and put forward Joe to father the new bible and the new faith. After the publication of the golden bible, they began to make converts rapidly. The revivals and other religious excitements had thrown up materials for the foundation of a new sect, they soon found they had not dug for money in vain—they began to preach—to pray—to see more visions—to prophesy and perform the most fantastic tricks—there was now no difficulty in getting a living and the gingerbread factory was abandoned. They created considerable talk over all this section of the country. Another revelation came upon them, and through Joe and some other of these prophets, they were directed to take up their march and go out to the promised land—to a place near Painesville, Ohio. Money was raised in a twinkling from the new converts. Their principles—their tenets—their organization—their discipline were as yet unformed and unfashioned, and probably are so to this day. Since they went toOhio they have adopted some of the worldly views of the Shakers and have formed a sort of community system where everything is in common. Joe Smith, Harris, the Ex-pedlar and the Ex-parson are among their elders and preachers—so also now is Phelps one of Mr. Granger’s leading anti-masonic editors in this village.Such a brief view of the rise and progress of the Mormon Religion one of the strangest pieces of fanaticism to which the ill-advised and the worst regulated ambition and folly of certain portions of the clergy in Western New York ever gave birth. What a lesson it ought to teach us!
MORMON BIBLE.. . . . I have met with the famous “Book of Mormon,” on board this canal boat; I believe I shall try and get a copy of it at Palmyra if I can, as I suppose you will be well pleased to see it. It is a curious production, about the size Owen and Campbell’s discussion, say nearly 600 pages quarto. It is written in the style of the Bible, and seems to be intended to corroborate the doctrines of the Old and New Testaments. It contains the history of Lehi and his descendants, a man who dates his genealogy from Pharoah’s Joseph. He is described as living in the days of Gedikiah, King of Judah; but being warned of God of the subsequent destruction of Jerusalem, he goes into a wilderness on the borders of the Red Sea, he and his wife and children, in order to avoid this destruction. Two of his children rebel against him at various times, and his wife sometimes, because of the hardships they encountered, and their disbelief in the threatened destruction of Jerusalem. However, one of his sons, Nephi, sees a number of visions in corroboration of his father’s story, and finally persuades Ishmael, a man who has just as many daughters and sons as Lehigh has sons and daughters, (who, of course, thus all get wives and husbands and a numerous offspring,) to believe his story, and to go with him into the wilderness. He also gets possession of certain brass plates, which contain his genealogy back to Joseph; and the Book of Mormon is part of an abridged record of the proceedings of Lehi’s descendants, whose leaders continued to write their history on brass plates. The plates from which Smith, the author translates his book are said to be in his possession. Ten persons say they have seen them and hefted them, three declare that an angel of God appeared to them and showed them to them, and told them that God had given Smith power to be able to read them, understand them, and translate them. The names of those persons are signed to the certificates in the book.The story I cannot very well understand, as the book is long and tedious. However, it is something like this: They take shipping to some unknown country, (I suppose this country,) then two of Lehi’s sons leave him and become a great nation, called Lawanites, from one of his sons. The other children remain with him and his son Nephi, become very numerous and are called Nephites. The Nephites are governed sometimes by kings, and then by judges as the Bible Jews. The story consists principally of the wars of the Nephites and Lawanites, (very bloody ones of course,) who finally, as was threatened for their disobedience, both utterly extirpate each other, after fix or six days of hard fighting of men, women and children. All are finally slain but the two leaders, who fight till one kills the other and falls dead at his side.It also contains many prophecies concerning Christ, which are of course fulfilled; for instance: during the night following his birth, although the son goes down, it remains perfectly light until he rises again next morning. And when Christ is crucified darkness pervades the earth for three days. Of course the Nephites, although they see these miracles, know nothing as to what these signs mean, (for Christ was crucified at Jerusalem,) except that their prophets tell them it shows Christ’s birth and death. But soon after his ascension into Heaven, he appears to the whole people of the Nephites, coming down from heaven from a cloud, and returning in like manner every evening. He visits them several days in this manner, chooses out twelve apostles, who receive wonderful gifts, institutes the sacrament of the Lord’s supper, preaches to them doctrines similar to the Bible doctrines, performs many miracles, healing the sick, raising the dead, and so on.In short, it is, in many respects, so similar to the Bible and such a parody on it, that a Christian might well write at the end of it, as some one wrote on the copy I saw: “This work seems throughout a burlesque on the Bible. Was it not got up by F. Wright and her party to show what ridiculous things people can be made to believe, and upon how little authority? The grammar and style seem to be good, as if written by one who understood composition,1 and the arrangement of sentences seems to be in exact accordance with the Bible.”It is divided into books, viz. Nephi, Jacob, Jarom, Omni, Mosiah, Alaca, Helaware, Nephi, Mormon, Ether, Marone, (all names of kings who kept the records,) and these books into chapters. I believe it is called the Book of Mormon because Mormon abridged it from the stories of the others. Smith says he found the plates in Manchester, Ontario co. N. Y. and, by the command and grace of God, translated and published them. I will write more about it if I find the book, on further perusal, worthy of further notice. or if I can find out anything more regarding the Mormonites themselves. One man writes on the copy I have read.“He who’d believe the plates of brass “Of Mr. Smith must be an ass.” W.O.
[My brother, Wm. Owen, not anticipating the publication of the extract which I gave to our readers last week, has sent me, for our paper, a more detailed account of the strange superstition now springing up in this country. I publish it entire, though it contains a few repetitions of what our readers already know, as having been given in the previous extract.]A COMPARISONBETWEEN THE BOOK OF MORMON AND THE SCRIPTURES OF THE OLD AND NEW TEATAMENTS,OR THE GOLDEN BIBLE VS. THE HOLY BIBLE.After a pretty careful perusal of the Book of Mormon, or the Golden Bible, as it is usually termed, I am of the opinion that, setting aside the historical proofs of authenticity, the Golden Bible will bear a very good comparison with the Holy Bible. I find nothing in the former inconsistent with the doctrines or opposed to a belief in the latter; on the contrary, the one seems to corroborate the other; and I can discover no good reason why the generality of Christians should scoff, as I have generally found them do, and hoot at the idea of believing in such a monstrously absurd book, unless it be that they consider the endeavor to pass off a new bible, very similar to their own, as a divine book, as likely to induce many persons, who cannot swallow the miracles and pretension of the Golden Bible, to question the veracity of the historians who relate similar miracles and put forth similar doctrines, in the Holy Bible, which they have been accustomed to venerate as a divine production. This view of the subject may be correct; for Christians can hardly read the book of Mormon without remarking a striking similarity to their own scriptures, and the believers in the Old and New Testaments cannot consistently deny the possibility of a single circumstance related in the Mormonite scriptures. However, for my own part, I should consider satisfactory proofs of the genuineness of the Golden Bible as strong evidence of the divine origin of the Holy Bible, so consistent they are with, and corroborative of, each other.The Holy Bible professes to be a history of the peopling of the old continent—the Golden Bible of the new continent. The one contains the record of the Jews, a chosen people of God, in the old world, together with numberless miracles performed by their holy men, and numerous prophecies concerning the coming of Christ; the other records the history of the Nephites, a chosen people of God, in the new world, whose holy men likewise perform numerous miracles and prophecy concerning Christ. The Jews have their Moses, their Aaron, their Joshua, their promised land, their kings, their judges, their seers, and the Jewish Christians their 12 Apostles. The Nephites have their Lehi, their Nephi, their Moroni, their promised land, their kings their judges, their prophets, their seers, and the Nephite Christians their 12 Apostles. Moses and Aaron led the Jews out of Egyptian bondage into their promised land. Lehi and Nephi led the Nephites out of Jerusalem, through fear of Babylonian bondage, into their promised land. Joshua fights the battles of the Jews—Moroni of the Nephites. The Jews have their Philistines—the Nephites their Lamanites, to slay them when rebellious against their God, whose great power and loving kindness both nations seem to have been singularly apt to forget. The book of the law, a priest professed to find, after it had been lost for several centuries, in the temple at Jerusalem, in Palestine. The book of Mormon, a layman professed to discover, secreted near Manchester, Ontario co. State of New York, U.S.A. The Jewish scriptures profess to prophecy regarding the utter dispersion of the Jews, which accordingly takes place. The Nephite scriptures proclaim the utter destruction of the Nephites, which likewise occurs as prophecied. Jesus Christ appears after his resurrection to many of his Jewish disciples and fills them with the Holy Ghost, which enables them to work miracles. He also heals the sick, raises the dead, institutes the Lord’s Supper, and orders those who believe in him to baptized with water. So says the Holy Bible. The Golden Bible informs us that Jesus Christ appeared to the Nephites, after his ascension, caused the Holy Ghost to descend on many of them, who thereby were enabled to perform miracles. He also heals their sick, raises the dead, and institutes the sacraments of Baptism and the Lord’s Supper. He preaches also to the Nephites, during several days, doctrines exactly similar to those recorded in the New Testament, and is finally caught up to Heaven in a cloud. A vision, during a journey, converts St. Paul, a Jew, from a zealous unbeliever in Christ, into an equally zealous Christian teacher. Alwa, a Nephite, is converted in like manner, and becomes, like Paul, a renowned Christian preacher. The miracles, too, recorded in both Bibles are precisely of the same character: The dead are raised, the sick healed, prison doors are opened, the Lord fights for his people in battle, unbelievers are struck dumb; at the death of Christ darkness pervades the land, together with earthquakes, lightning, &c. We have also wars without end, visions and prophecies. God also shows himself to one or two persons, and a few others are translated to Heaven, without dying. In these and many other respects, the two bibles present a great resemblance; but in some points the Nephites are much less barbarous than the Jews. Amongst them we have no Midianitish massacres, or wholesale butcheries of entire nations, in order to possess their lands. The Nephites take possession of an uninhabited country and people it; they never take up arms in their own defence, and some of them even suffer death, rather than defend themselves at all.The doctrinal parts of both bibles are so similar that I am not able to point out any material difference between them, except that the Nephite Christians had no hired priest among them, for all their religious teachers labored with their hands. The historical part of the Golden Bible is shortly as follows.Two Jewish families, warned of God, leave Jerusalem to avoid the Babylonian captivity, and, instructed by God, build a tight ship and are driven they know not whither; (to America.) They become a great nation, called Nephites, from a famous leader and prophet. Two of his brothers and their families withdraw from the Nephite’s people and form another nation called Lawanites, who become savages, having no law to guide them. These are our American Indians. They are described as being dark (the Lord having set a mark upon them) with sha-[pp.368]ven heads, except a small tuft of hair, and naked except round the loins, and barbarous, fierce and savage. They are continually at war with the Nephites, and are beaten, whenever the Nephites follow the commands of God; finally, however, the Nephites become very wicked and the Lawanites kill the whole of them, about 200,000 in desperate battle. One man alone escapes who writes the conclusion of their history on a plate of brass, and hides it by God’s command, together with a number of plates which contain the whole history of the Nephites, written at each period, by their leader for the time being, and by him handed to his successor in office, to be preserved and continued by him until his death, to be by him handed to his successor, and so on. These plates, Smith the publisher of the Golden Bible professes to have discovered and translated by the help of God. Eleven witnesses, three of whom profess to have been taught the truth of the book by an angel from heaven, and profess to have seen the plates. The style is very Biblical, and the grammar good, with few exceptions. Smith is said to be illiterate. The believers in the book of Morman amount already to about 1600. They have been living near Fairport, Ohio, but are going to Missouri so soon as they can get land there to settle on. A man who resides near them, told me he knew many of them, and that they were generally very peaceable, inoffensive men and of good character. Their preachers appear to have drawn great crowds to hear them preach.
MORMONISM. The fact that a sect of fanatics calling themselves Mormonites, have sprung up and extended themselves in the Western part of New York and the Eastern parts of Ohio, is partially known to our reader. The origin, character and members of this sect have not yet been notice in the Gazette, and it seems proper now to notice them.The ostensible founder of this fanaticism is a man of the name Smith, an ignorant, indolent, careless shiftless fellow in the commencement of life. His father, named Joseph Smith, also, in his early days had been a country pedlar in New England, and subsequently a manufacturer and vendor of gingerbread, in a small way, in Manchester, N.Y. Some years ago these two, father and son, conceived that money was buried in the earth between Lake Canandaigua ad Palmyra on the Erie Canal, and commenced digging to find it, in company with several persons whom they persuaded to join them. After a time they engaged a man who resided near Paynesville, in Ohio, to assist and instruct them, under the persuasion that he possessed eminent skill in money finding. He had been a preacher of several sect in religion, was a shrewd cunning man, of considerable talent and great plausibility. Under his direction the digging for money was again commenced, and the younger Smith gave out that he had found a set of golden plates, concealed in an iron chest, and buried in the earth, upon which was engraved the book of Mormon. By a special inspiration from God the younger Smith was enabled to translate the engravings upon these plates into English, and having made a convert of an individual of the name of Harris, who had some property, he mortgaged his farm, and raised money to defray the expense of printing it, and it was accordingly published in Palmyra, N.Y. making a duodecimo volume of respectable size. The book is supposed to have been written by an ex-preacher, whose name is giving as Henry Rangdon, or Ringdon. After the publication of the book, the younger Smith began to exhibit himself as a prophet divinely inspired. He prayed, preached, and made converts. He “put money in his purse,” and in consequence of a divine revelation, removed with his converts to the neighborhood of Painesville, Ohio. Here his converts increased rapidly; and recently a company of about one hundred emigrated from that place to some promised land upon the Missouri, taking with them their common means, their religious instructors, and their Mormon bibles. These people were of the laboring and farming classes, appeared to be decent and respectable. Though coarsely dressed, their clothes were clean and whole, and their demeanor was quiet and devout. Part of them remain in the neighborhood of Painesville, where it is understood they continue to make converts. The last we heard from the Missouri emigrants was, that theywere at some loss to find the promised land. They maintain a community ofproperty, and repose their religious faith upon the book of Mormon as their bible, and the dogmas of their prophets. The book is a cunningly devised tissue of incongruities, adapted to vulgar prejudice, and written in imitation of the style of the Scriptures, and contains frequent allusions to scripture history and doctrines. It is a singular proof of the proneness of the human heart to idolatry, that such a gross and absurd imposition should find disciples, in the midst of the religious light that is spread abroad and every where surrounds us, in this country. It ought to a dmonish every teacher of religion who feels himself affected by a fiery zeal, whether of exclusive orthodoxy or of diffusive schism, to beware that he does not also become a fanatic. Cincinnati Gazette
For the Watchman. BOOK OF MORMON. This is a volume of about six hundred pages in octavo, written by Josiah Smith, jun. Did not this book claim the honours of divine revelation, and had it not been received as a substitute for the Bible, by the followers of Smith, who call themselves Mormonites, a review would have been needless; the follies and extravagances of the work itself would have consigned it to the oblivion which it merits. It is, however, a melancholy fact, that a very considerable number of well-meaning people are imposed upon by it. It seems therefore proper, that some brief notice should be taken of it.Smith pretends that he translated the work from inscriptions on certain metallic plates, found in the Township of Manchester, in the county of Ontario, New-York. Smith does not pretend that he was able, without a miracle, to decipher a single character inscribed on the plates; of course, the plates were not a revelation to him, and they can be none to us: we can trace this revelation no higher than to Josiah Smith, jr. and its credibility depends wholly upon the evidence we have that he was divinely inspired. The inscriptions on the plates are said to have been made by a succession of prophets: the first and most eminent of whom was Nephi, the son of Lehi. The account he gives of himself, is, that in the beginning of the reign of Zedekiah, king of Judah, his father, being warned of God, fled from Jerusalem, three day journey into the wilderness, and encamped, with his family and effects, in a valley by a river, near the border of the Red Sea. This, it must be confessed, was a most extraordinary journey; to go from Jerusalem to the Red Sea, with his wife, children, tents and baggage, in three days, was to travel with unparalleled celerity, page 7 and 8. The plates were inscribed in the language of the Egyptians, see page 5. As Nephi was a descendant from Joseph, probably Smith would have us understand, that the Egyptian language was retained in the family of Joseph; of this, however, we have no evidence.After Lehi and his family had wandered in the wilderness, near the Red Sea, eight years, where they supported themselves by hunting, they came to a fertile country, which they call the land Bountiful. This country, according to the description Nephi has given of the course of his travels, must have been on the coast of the Sea of Arabia, or the Indian Ocean, which is a barren, sandy desert. Here Nephi built, rigged and victualled a ship to sail to the land of promise, p. 47. The land of promise was, of course, North America. The historical part of the hook is, all of it, thus fabulous and extravagant. Arabia is represented as an uninhabited wilderness, where they could encamp on the most fertile spots, and support themselves by killing wild animals; whereas the truth is, that every habitable part of that country was at that time occupied by tribes, the most fierce, and the most jealous of the intrusion of strangers, of any people in the world. It is calculated that there are now, about 17 millions of inhabitants in Arabia; and six hundred years before Christ, when Lehi and his family are said to have passed through it, there were probably double that number. To believe the book of Mormon, we must suppose that these emigrants traversed almost the whole length of the Arabian Gulf, without finding any inhabitants, where any body else would have encountered a number of populous cities; and that they discovered a country almost equal to paradise, where no body else can find any thing but a sandy, barren desert.After the arrival of Nephi and his friends in the land of promise, that is, America, they found plenty of oxen and cows and horses and all sorts of cattle, p. 49. Here they settled and flourished, and we have a history of kings, their wars, revolutions and successions for a number of hundreds of years. Christianity was planted amongst them, and, even, it is pretended that Jesus Christ came personally amongst them; and after all, the Nephites became corrupted, and for their apostacy were totally exterminated.Of the truth of this history, we have no evidence only what is written on the plates, and that writing no man can read. Smith, we are told, was assisted by an angel to translate the plates. This angel may, for ought we know, be thoroughly acquainted with the Egyptian language; but he is certainly a very poor English scholar; and if he is as defective in Egyptian grammar, as he is in English, we can place very little confidence in the integrity of the translation. The prophetic part of the book, so far as we can know any thing concerning it, relates to events already past. The doctrine taught in it, is similar to that of the free-will Baptists. There are many important truths interspersed in the work, and, as a whole, it appears to have been the production of a strong uncultivated mind, aided by a very lively imagination. As a work of imagination, it might have passed as an ill-written romance, and we should have been at liberty to read it, or not, as we thought proper; but as it demands our faith as a divine revelation, it becomes our duty to examine it.Nephi says, p. 114, “Wo be unto him that shall say, we have received the word of God, and we need no more of the word of God, for we have enough.” P. 116, Wherefore, because ye have Bible, “ye need not suppose that it contains all my words.”―“For behold I shall speak unto the Jews, and they shall write it; and I shall also speak unto the Nephites, and they shall write it; and I shall also speak unto the other tribes of the house of Israel, which I have led away, and they shall write it; and I shall also speak unto the nations of the earth, and they shall write it.” Nephi, however, was no prophet, was not under divine inspiration; for he says, p. 50, “Nevertheless, I do not write any thing upon plates, save it be that I think it to be sacred. And now if I do err, even did they err of old. Not that I would excuse myself because of other men, but because [column 2] of the weakness which is in me, according to the flesh, I would excuse myself.” No man who was writing under the influence of the infallible Spirit of divine inspiration, would suppose himself to be liable to err, neither would he have traduced the ancient prophets, by charging them with having erred. Nephi is a creature of fancy, generated in the brains of Josiah Smith, jr.; but he, as well as the succession of prophets which followed him, were kings, and the whole fabric is calculated to establish a religious despotism: and if Smith can gain followers, and they allow his claims of divine inspiration, he will, of course, become their absolute ruler.In the close of the book is inserted the testimony of three witnesses, who say that an angel brought the plates from heaven, and laid them before them. But who knows whether the plates which the angel brought from heaven, are the same that Smith says he found in Manchester?―Another set of eight witnesses, testify, that Smith showed them the plates, and that the engraving on them appeared very ancient and curious.―This, however, does not prove that the engraving on the plates is the original of what is written in Smith’s book. GIMEL.
Mormonites.― The Hampshire Gazette says:― A lady from Ohio informs us, that many of the Mormonites in Geauga county have started for the promised land in Missouri; some of them passed through the town in which she resides; their language was―‘we have left Babylon and are going to Mount Zion.’ Among those who have embraced the doctrines of these fanatics are two merchants, and some respectable farmers. One man joined them whose property was estimated at 7,000 dollars. The lady to whom we have alluded found in the Lake steam boat a Mormonite woman on her return to Boston. She said she had made a journey all the way from Boston to Ohio to investigate the subject of Mormonism and had satisfied herself that the Mormon bible was a revelation from God, and the leaders true prophets. She stated that others from Boston had become converts to the new system. She believed that the Mormonites could perform miracles. When asked if she had seen any miraculous operations, she replied that she had seen a person who was very sick suddenly restored to health. On other subjects she conversed like a sensible, pious woman. She stated that she was a Methodist when she left Boston.
MORMONISM—No. III. Nelson, Portage Co. Oct. 24, 1831.REV. & DEAR SIR— Mormonism has in part changed its character, and assumed a different dress, from that under which it first made its appearance on the Western Reserve. Many extraordinary circumstances which then existed, have vanished out of sight; and the Mormonites desire, not only to forget them, but wish them blotted out of the memory of others. Those wonders, which they wish to have forgotten, stand as the principal foundation of the faith of several hundred of the members of their church.With the Wonders of Mormonism, or some of them, I design to occupy your attention in this letter; and I wish you to observe here, and hereafter remember, that the evidence by which all my statements are supported, is derived from my own experience and observation, or from the testimony of persons, who still adhere to Mormonism; and I hold myself responsible to any tribunal, whether on Earth or in Heaven, for the truth of what I write, or at least, for an intention to write the truth, and nothing but the truth.“Being carried away in the spirit,” and “I know it to be so by the spirit,” are well known phrases, and in common use in the Mormonite church. We will first notice the gift of tongues, exercised by some when carried away in the spirit. These persons were apparently lost to all surrounding circumstances, and wrapt up in the contemplation of things, and in communicating with persons not present.—They articulated sounds, which but few present professed to understand; and those few, declared them to be the Indian language. A merchant, who had formerly been a member of the Methodist society, observed, he had formerly traded with the Indians, and he knew it to be their dialect. Being myself present on some of these occasions, a person proffered his services as my interpreter, and translated these sounds, which to me were unintelligible, into the English language. One individual could read any chapter in the Old or New-Testament, in several different languages. This was known to be the case by a person who professed to understand those languages. In the midst of this delirium, they would, at times, fancy themselves addressing a congregation of their red brethren; and mounted upon a stump, or the fence, or from some elevated situation, would harangue their assembly, until they had convinced and converted them. They would then lead them into the water, and baptize them, and pronounce their sins forgiven. In this exercise, some of them actually went into the water; and in the water, performed the ceremony used in baptizing. These actors assumed the visage of the savage, and so nearly imitated him, not only in language, but in gestures and actions, that it seemed the soul and body were completely metamorphosed into the Indian. No doubt was then entertained but that this was an extraordinary work of the Lord, designed to prepare those young men for the Indian mission; and many who are still leaders in the church, could say, “we know by the spirit that it is the work of the Lord.” And now they can say, “we know by the spirit that it is the work of the Devil.” Most of those who were the principal actors, have since apostatized, and the work is unanimously discarded by the church. The limits, which my want of time to write, as well as your want of patience to read, compel me to prescribe for myself, will allow me only to touch on some of the most prominent parts of this newly-invented, and heterogeneous system.A new method for obtaining authority to preach the Gospel was introduced into the church. One declared he had received a commission, directly from Heeven, written upon parchment. Another, that it was written upon the palm of his hand, and upon the lid of his Bible, &c. Three witnesses, and they were formerly considered persons of veracity, testified, that they saw the parchment, or something like it, when put into the hands of the candidate. These commissions, when transcribed upon a piece of paper, were read to the church, and the persons who had received them, were ordained to the Elder’s office, and sent out into the world to preach. But this also sunk into discredit, and experienced the fate of the former.Visions, also, were in high credit, and sounded abroad as an infallible testimony in favor of Mormonism. The visionary, at times, imagined he saw the City of New-Jerusalem; unlocked its gate, and entered within the walls; passed through its various apartments, and then returned, locked the gate, and put the key into his pocket. When this tour was finished, he would entertain his admiring friends, with a detailed description of the Heavenly City.The condition of the ten tribes of Israel since their captivity, unto the present time, has excited considerable anxiety, and given rise to much speculation among the learned. But after all the researches which have been made, the place of their residence has never been satisfactorily ascertained. But these visionaries have discovered their place of residence to be contiguous to the north pole; separated from the rest of the world, by impassable mountains of ice and snow. In this sequestered residence, they enjoy the society of Elijah the Prophet, and John the Revelator, and perhaps the three immortalized Nephites.—By and by, the mountains of ice and snow are to give way, and open a passage for the return of these tribes, to the land of Palestine.About this time, the ministration of angels was supposed to be frequent in the church. The Heavenly visitants made their appearance to certain individuals: they seldom made any communication, but presented themselves as spectacles for the beholder to gaze upon, with silent admiration.Smith is the only person at present, to my knowledge, who pretends to hold converse with the inhabitants of the celestial world. It seems from his statements, that he can have access to them, when and where he pleases. He does not pretend that he sees them with his natural, but with his spiritual eyes; and he says he can see them as well with his eyes shut, as with them open. So also in translating.—The subject stands before his eyes in print, but it matters not whether his eyes are open or shut; he can see as well one way as the other.You have probably read the testimony of the three witnesses appended to the Book of Mormon. These witnesses testify, that an angel appeared to them, and presented them the golden plates, and the voice of God declared it to be a Divine Record. To this they frequently testify, in the presence of large congregations. When in Missouri, I had an opportunity to examine a commandment given to these witnesses, previous to their seeing the plates. They were informed that they should see and hear those things by faith, and then they should testify to the world, as though they had seen and heard, as I see a man, and hear his voice: but after all, it amounts simply to this; that by faith or imagination, they saw the plates and the angel, and by faith or imagination, they heard the voice of the Lord.Smith describes an angel, as having the appearance of “a tall, slim, well built, handsome man, with a bright pillar upon his head.” The Devil once, he says, appeared to him in the same form, excepting upon his head he had a “black pillar,” and by this mark, he was able to distinguish him from the former.It passes for a current fact in the Mormonite church, that there are immense treasures in the earth, especially in those places in the State of N. Y. from whence many of the Mormonites emigrated last spring: and when they become sufficiently purified, these treasures are to be poured into the lap of their church; and then, to use their own language, they are to be the richest people in the world. These treasures were discovered several years since, by means of the dark glass, the same with which Smith says he translated most of the Book of Mormon.—Several of those persons, together with Smith, who were formerly unsuccessfully engaged in digging and searching for these treasures, now reside in this county, and from themselves I received this information. Yours, affectionately. EZRA BOOTH.
MORMONISM—No. VI. Nelson, Portage Co. Nov 14, 1831.REV. & DEAR SIR— It is well known that the ostensible design of the Mormonites in settling in the western part of Missouri, is to convert the Indians to the faith of Mormonism. In this, the leaders appear to have in view, as a mode, the Jesuits of the 16th century, who established themselves in South America, by gaining an entire ascendancy over the hearts and consciences of the natives, and thereby became their masters. As Independence is the place of general rendezvous, and head-quarters of the Mormonites, it may not be amiss to notice it. It is a new Town, containing a courthouse, built of brick, two or three merchant stores, and fifteen or twenty dwelling houses, built mostly of logs hewed on both sides; and is situated on a handsome rise of ground, about three miles south of the Missouri river, and about twelve miles east of the dividing line between the U. S. and the Indian Reserves and is the County seat of Jackson County. In this place, it is designed to establish the Lord’s printing press, of which Wm. W. Phelps and O. Cowdery, are to have the management; and also, the Lord’s storehouse, committed in charge to S. Gilbert. By the means of these two grand engines, they expect to make the wicked feel the effect of their tremendous power. West of the line lies the territory, selected by the Government of the U.S. for the future residence of the Indians; to which place, a number of tribes have recently emigrated. The question is frequently asked, do the Indians seem disposed to receive Mormonism; or have any of them as yet embraced it? To which question, I have heard some of the leaders reply, “O yes,” when the truth is, not an individual had embraced it when I left that place, nor is there any prospect they will embrace it. It is true, that some of the Indians appear to listen with a degree of attention, while the Mormonite teacher pretends to disclose to them the secret of their origin, the history of their ancestors, and that the Great Spirit designs, in this generation, to restore them to the possession of their lands, now occupied by the whites; and the Indians shall go forth among the white people, “as a lion among the beasts of the forest, and as a young lion, among the flocks of sheep, who, if he goeth through, both treadeth down and teareth to pieces, and no man can deliver. Thy hand shall be lifted upon their adversaries, (the whites,) and all their enemies (the whites) shall be cut off.” Here you have a fair specimen of the method adopted in the Book of Mormon, and preached by the Mormonite teachers, for the purpose of enlisting the feelings, and ingratiating themselves with the Indians; and should success attend their endeavors; and the minds of the Indians become inflamed with that enthusiastic spirit which Mormonism inspires, they may be inclined to try the experiment, whether “by the shedding of blood,” they can expel the white inhabitants, or reduce them to a state of servitude; and by this means, regain the possession of the lands occupied by their forefathers.The laying of the foundation of Zion was attended with considerable parade, and an ostentatious display of talents, both by Rigdon and Cowdery. The place being designated as the site where the city was to commence, on the day appointed we repaired to the spot, not only as spectators, but each one to act the part assigned him in the great work of laying the foundation, of the “glorious City of the New-Jerusalem.” Rigdon consecrated the ground, by an address in the first place to the God whom the Mormonites profess to worship; and then making some remarks respecting the extraordinary purpose for which we were assembled, prepared the way for administering the oath of allegiance, to those who, were then to receive their “everlasting inheritance” in that City. He laid them under the most solemn obligations, to constantly obey all the commandments of Smith. He enjoined it upon them to express a great degree of gratitude for the free donation, and then, as the Lord’s Vicegerent, he gratuitously bestowed upon them, that for which they had paid an exorbitant price in money. These preliminaries being ended, a shrub oak, about ten inches in diameter at the butt, the best that could be obtained near at hand, was prostrated, trimmed, and cut off at a suitable length; and twelve men, answering to the twelve Apostles, by the means of handspikes, conveyed it to the place. Cowdery craved the privilege of laying the corner-stone. He selected a small rough stone, the best he could find, carried it in one hand to the spot, removed the surface of the earth to prepare a place for its reception, and then displayed his oratorical power, in delivering an address, suited to the important occasion. The stone being placed, one end of the shrub oak stick was laid upon it; and there was laid down the first stone and stick, which are to form an essential part of the splendid City of Zion.The next day the ground for the Temple was consecrated, and Smith claimed the honor of laying the corner-stone himself. Should the inhabitants of Independence, feel a desire to visit the place, destined at some future time to become celebrated, they will have only to walk one half of a mile out of the Town, to a rise of ground, a short distance south of the road. They will be able to ascertain the spot, by the means of a sappling, distinguished from others by the bark being taken off on the north and on the east side.—On the south side of the sappling will be found the letter, T. which stands for Temple; and on the east side ZOM for Zomar; which Smith says is the original word for Zion. Near the foot of the sappling, they will find a small stone, covered over with bushes, which were cut for that purpose. This is the corner-stone for the Temple. They can there have the privilege of beholding the mighty work, accomplished by about thirty men, who left their homes, travelled 1000 miles, most of them on foot, and expended more than one thousand dollars in cash.Having completed the work, or rather, finding but little or no business for us to accomplish in Missouri, most of us became anxious to return home. And none appeared to be more so than Smith and Rigdon, whose plans for future subsistence were considerably frustrated. They expected to find a country abounding with the necessaries and comforts of life. But the prospect appeared somewhat gloomy, and will probably remain so for years to come. That they were disappointed, is evident from the change which appeared in their calculations. Before they went to Missouri, their language was, “we shall winter in Ohio but one winter more;” and when in Missouri, “it will be many years before we come here for the Lord has a great work for us to do in Ohio,” and the great work is, to make a thorough alteration of the Bible, and invent new revelations, and these are to be sent to Missouri, in order to be printed. This economy to save the expense of postage, is parallel with their other calculations. But no matter for that, it will save them the difficulties and hardships incident to settling a new country; and also the dangers to which they would be exposed, in case the Indians should commence hostilities upon the whites; and moreover, they have an easy method to supply themselves with cash at any time when occasion requires. The authority of a commandment, will easily untie the purse-strings, of those whose consciences are under their control; and they find it much easier, and better suited to their dispositions, to write commandments, than to gain a livelihood by the sweat of their brow; and indeed, Smith has commanded himself not to labor, and by his mandate, has enjoined it upon the Church to support him. The Bishop, when we were in Missouri, intimated, that he and others were too much inclined to indolence. He replied, “I am commanded not to labor.”Yours affectionately.EZRA BOOTH.
THE MORMONITES. A Preacher of this sect visited us last Saturday. We heard a part of his lecture, which occupied more than two hours.—From his account this sect came into existence a little more than a year since in the following manner. A young man about 23 years of age, somewhere in Ontario county, N. Y. was visited by an angel! [here the preacher looked around him apparently to see if the credulity of the people in this enlightened age could be thus imposed upon] who appeared to him three times in one night that by visiting a certain place in that town he would have revealed to him something of importance. The young man was disturbed but did not obey the summons until the following day, when the angel again visited him. At the place appointed he found in the earth a box which contained a set of thin plates resembling gold, with Arabic characters inscribed on them. The plates were minutely described as being connected with rings in the shape of the letter D, when facilitated the opening and shutting of the book. The preacher said he found in the same place two stones, with which he was enabled by placing them over his eyes and putting his head in a dark corner, to decypher the hieroglyphics on the plates! This we were told was performed to admiration, and now, as the result, we have a book which the speaker informed us was the Mormon Bible—a book second to no other—without which the holy bible, he seemed to think, would be of little use.It appears from his statement, that three of the offsprings of Joseph, by his youngest son Ephraim, whose names were Laman, Nephi, and Lehigh, as near as we could understand, were the persons from whom sprang Mormon. Laman and Nephi rather declined from walking in the right way, but Lehigh was firm in the faith—Mormon was a prophet, led them eastward until they came to the sea, as we suppose, where they built a ship and came to this western world. To prove this, the preacher referred us to Genesis,10th chapter and 22d verse, and said the branches running over the wall was further more nor less than the progeny of Joseph leaving their own and coming to this country! He went into a detail on the readiness which induced him to join this people—that on account of so many sects being in the world, and the discrepancies in their opinions, he became sceptical—that hearing of these people in July last, he joined himself to them, believing them to constitute the true Church—and that he came this way to meet a convocation of elders in Jackson county, Missouri, which is to be their New Jerusalem, but was disappointed to not seeing them there. He insisted on the Bible being joined with his book, by quoting the 16th and 17th verses of the 37th chapter of Ezekiel, and comparing the Bible and Mormon’s book to the two sticks there spoken of. We thought this part of his subject too ludicrous to be refuted by any man in his right mind. We cannot now enter into the merits of his discourse, nor should we have given this hastily written sketch, had we not been requested to say something on the subject. Some of these men may be sincere, but does this prove they are in the right? The worshippers of Juggernant are sincere, or they would not sacrifices their lives by throwing themselves under the wheels of its life-destroying car.
MORMONISM. The letter of Mr. Booth, on the first page of this paper, notwithstanding its prolixity, will be found very interesting. We have reason to believe that these letters are exerting an important influence in opening the eyes of many of the really deluded subjects of Mormonism. Hence, in its exposure, the writer discharges an important though painful duty. They will soon be closed.
For the Ohio Star MORMONISM—No. VII.Nelson, Portage Co. Nov. 21, 1831.REV.&DEAR SIR— The following, with but little variation, is the copy of a letter which was written to the Bishop of the Mormonite Church, who, by commandment, has received his station, and now resides in Missouri. His business is to superintend the secular concerns of the Church. He holds a deed of the lands, and the members receive a writing from him, signifying, that they are to possess and occupy the land as their own, so long as they are obedient to Smith’s commandments. The Bishop is, in reality, the Vice-gerent of Smith, and those in collusion with him; and holds his office during their will and pleasure. I think him to be an honest man as yet, but there is a point beyond which he cannot go, unless he prostrates his honor as in the dust, and prostitutes his conscience to the vilest of purposes. He has frequently staggered and been ready to fall. The Conference last year gave him a tremendous shock, from which, with difficulty, he recovered. The law of the Church enjoins, that no debts with the world shall be contracted. But a thousand acres of land in the town of Thompson, could be purchased for one half its value, and he was commanded to secure it; and in order to do it, he was under the necessity to contract a debt with the world, to the amount of several hundred dollars. He hesitated, but the command was repeated, “you must secure the land.” He was one of the number, who was ordained to the gift of discerning spirits; and in a commandment, a pattern was given by which the good spirit might be distinguished from the bad, which rendered the gift of spiritual discernment useless: for the division was to be made from external appearances, and not from any thing discovered internally.—He saw the impropriety and it shook his faith. I am suspicious that the time is not far distant, when, by commandment, this office will be bestowed upon a more trusty and confidential person; perhaps Smith’s brother or father, or some one who has been disciplined in the State of New-York. Then it will become his business, to make over the property, by deed of conveyance, to the person appointed by commandment to supersede him. The Mormonites will tell you, that business of this nature is done by the voice of the Church. It is like this: a Sovereign issues his decrees, and then says to his subjects, hold up your right hands, in favor of my decrees being carried into effect. Should any refuse, they are sure to be hung for rebellion.SEPT.20,1831.MR.PARTRIDGE—SIR:—From a sense of duty, I take up my pen, to communicate to you the present impressions of my mind, which originated from facts, which occurred during my stay there, and while returning home. I arrived safely at my home on the 1st inst. after having passed through a variety of scenes, some of which, I design to disclose to you in this letter. You will probably be surprised, when you learn, that I am no longer a member of the Mormonite Church. The circumstances which led to this are numerous, and of such character, that I should have been compelled to sacrifice every principle of honesty, or cease to support a system, which I conceived to be grossly inconsistent, and in opposition to the best interest of human society. The first thing that materially affected my mind, so as to weaken my confidence, was the falsehood of Joseph’s vision. You know perfectly well, that Joseph had, or said he had, a vision, or revelation, in which it was made known to him by the spirit, that Oliver had raised up a great Church in Missouri. This was so confidently believed, previous to our leaving Ohio, that while calculating the number in the Church, several hundred were added, supposed to be in Missouri. This great Church was found to consist of three or four females. The night we took lodgings in the school-house, and the morning which succeeded it, presented circumstances which I had not anticipated. When you intimated to Joseph that the land which he and Oliver had selected, was inferior in point of quality to other land adjoining, had you seen the same spirit manifested in me, which you saw in him, would you not have concluded me to be under the influence of violent passion, bordering on madness, rather than the meek and gentle spirit which the Gospel inculcates? When you complained that he had abused you, and observed to him, “I wish you not to tell us any more, that you know these by the spirit when you do not; you told us, that Oliver had raised up a large Church here, and there is no such thing,” he replied, “I see it, and it will be so.” This appeared to me, to be a shift, better suited to an imposter, than a true Prophet of the Lord. And from that time I resolved, to weigh well every circumstance; and I can assure you, that no one that has any bearing on the subject, escaped my notice. But the spirit considered you insolence to Joseph, too intolerable, too be passed over unnoticed. Hence the commandment: “if he repent not of his sins, which is unbelief and blindness of heart, let him take heed lest he fall. Behold his mission is given unto him, and it shall not be given again.” You are to be careful, to submit patiently to all the abuse which Joseph sees fit to pour upon you; and to swallow passively, all the spurious visions, and false prophecies, that he in his clemency thinks proper to bestow upon you, lest you fall from your Bishoprick, never to regain it. These men, under whose influence you act, were entire strangers to you, until you embraced this new system of faith. Now, permit me to inquire, have you not frequently observed in Joseph, a want of that sobriety, prudence, and stability, which are some of the most prominent traits in the christian character? Have you not often discovered in him, a spirit of lightness and levity, a temper of mind easily irritated, and an habitual proneness to jesting and joking? Have you not repeatedly proved to your own satisfaction, that he says he knows things to be so by the spirit, when they are not so? You most certainly have. Have you not reason then to believe, or at least to suspect, that the revelations which come from him, are something short of infallible, and instead of being the production of divine wisdom, emanate from his own weak mind? Some suppose his weakness, nay, his wickedness, can form no reasonable objection to his revelations; and “were he to get another man’s wife, and seek to kill her husband, it could be no reason why we should not believe revelations through him, for David did the same.” So Sidney asserted, and many others concur with him in the sentiment. The commandment we received to purchase, or make a water craft, direct us to proceed down the river in it as far as St. Louis, and from thence, with the exception of Joseph and his two scribes, we were to proceed on our journey home two by two. The means of conveyance being procured, we embarked for St. Louis, but unpropitious events rolled on, superseded the commandment, frustrated our plans, and we had separated before we had accomplished one half of the voyage. The cause which produced this disastrous result, was a spirit of animosity and discord, which made its appearance on board, the morning after we left Independence. The conduct of some of the Elders became highly displeasing to Oliver, who, in the greatness of his power, uttered this malediction; “as the Lord God liveth, if you do not behave better, some accident will befal you.” The manner in which this was handed out, evinced it to be the ebullition of a spirit, similar to that which influenced Joseph in the school-house. No accident however befel them, until Joseph in the afternoon of the third day, assumed the direction of affairs on board of that canoe, which, with other matters of difference, together with Oliver’s curse increased the irritation of the crew, who, in time of danger, refused to exert their physical powers, in consequence of which, they ran foul of a sawyer, and were in danger of upsetting. This was sufficient to flutter the timid spirit of the Prophet and his scribe, who had accompanied him on board that canoe, and like the sea-tossed mariner, when threatened with the horrors of a watery grave, they unanimously desired, to set their feet once more upon something more firm than a liquid surface: therefore, by the persuasion of Joseph, we landed before sunset, intending to pass the night upon the bank of the river. Preparations were made to spend the night as comfortably as existing circumstances would admit, and then an attempt was made, to affect a reconciliation betwixt the contending parties. The business of settlement commenced, which elicited much conversation, and excited considerable feeling on both sides. Oliver’s denunciation was brought into view; his conduct and equipage, were compared to “a fop of a sportsman;” he and Joseph were represented, as highly imperious and quite dictatorial: and Joseph and Sidney, were reprimanded for their excessive cowardice. Joseph seemed inclined to arm himself according to his usual custom, in case of opposition, with the judgments of God, for the purpose of pouring them, like a thunder bolt upon the rebellious Elders; but one or two retorted, “none of your threats:” which completely disarmed him, and he reserved his judgment for a more suitable occasion. Finding myself but little interested in the settlement, believing the principles of discord too deeply rooted to be easily eradicated, I laid myself down upon the ground, and to silence, contemplated awhile the events of the evening, as they passed before me. These are the men to whom the Lord has intrusted the mysteries, and the keys of his kingdom; whom he has authorized to bind or loose on earth, and their decision shall be ratified in Heaven. These are the men sent forth, to promulge a new revelation, and to usher in a new dispensation—at whose presence the “Heavens are to shake, the hills tremble, the mountains quake, and the earth open and swallow up their enemies.”—These are the leaders of the Church, and the only Church on earth the Lord beholds with approbation. Surely, I never witnessed so much confusion and discord, among the Elders of any other Church; nevertheless they are all doomed to a perpetual curse, except they receive the doctrines and precepts which Mormonism inculcates, and place themselves under the tuition of men, more ignorant and unholy than themselves. In the midst of meditations like these, I sunk into the arms of sleep, but was awakened at a late hour, to witness and consent to a reconciliation, between the parties. The next morning, Joseph manifested an aversion to risk his person any more, upon the rough and rapid current of the Missouri, and in fact, upon any other river; and he again had recourse to his usual method, of freeing himself from obtaining another in opposition to it. He succeeded according to his desires. A new commandment was issued, in which a great curse was pronounced against the waters; navigating them, was to be attended with extreme danger; and all the saints in general, were prohibited journeying upon them to the promised land. From this circumstance, the Missouri river was named the river of Destruction. It was decreed, that we should proceed on our journey by land, and preach by the way as we passed along. Joseph, Sidney and Oliver, were to press their way forward with all possible speed, and to preach only in Cincinnati; and there they were to lift up their voices, and proclaim against the whole of that wicked City. The method by which Joseph and Co. designed to proceed home, it was discovered, would be very expensive. “The Lord don’t care how much money it takes to get us home,” said Sidney. Not satisfied with the money they received from you, they used their best endeavors to exact money from others, who had but little, compared with what they had; telling them in substance, “you can beg your passage, on foot, but as we are to travel in the stage, we must have money.” You will find, sir, that the expense of these three men, was one hundred dollars more than three of our company expended, while on our journey home; and for the sake of truth and honesty, let these men never again open their mouths, to insult the common sense of mankind, by contending for equality, and the community of goods in society, until there is a through alteration in their mthod of proceeding. It seems, however, they had drained their pockets, when they arrived at Cincinnati, for they were there under the necessity of pawning their trunk, in order to continue their journey home. Here they violated the commandment, by not preaching; and when an inquiry was made respecting the cause of that neglect, at one time they said, they could get no house to preach in; at another time they stated, that they could have had the court-house, had they staid a day or two longer, but the Lord made it known to them, that they should go on; and other similar excuses, involving like contradictions. Thus they turn and twist the commandments, to suit their whims, and they violate them when they please with perfect impunity. They can at any time obtain a commandment suited to their desires, and as their desires fluctuate and become reversed, they get a new one to supersede the other, and hence the contradictions which abound in this species of revelation. The next day after we were cast upon the shore, and had commenced our journey by land, myself and three others went on board of a canoe, and re-commenced our voyage down the river. From this time a constant gale of prosperity wafted us forward, and not an event transpired, but what lended to our advance, until we arrived at our much-desired homes. At St. Louis we took passage in a steam-boat, and came to Wellsville; and from thence in the stage home. We travelled about eight hundred miles farther than the three who took their passage in the stage, and arrived at our homes but a few days later. It is true we violated the commandment by not preaching by the way, and so did they by not preaching in Cincinnati. But it seems that none of us considered the commandment worthy of much notice.In this voyage upon the waters, we demonstrated that the great dangers existed only in imagination, and the commandment to be the offspring of a pusillanimous spirit. The spirit also revealed to Joseph, that “on the steam-boats, plots were already laid for our destruction.” This too we proved to be false. While descending the Missouri river, Peter and Frederick, two of my company, divulged a secret respecting Oliver, which placed his conduct on a parallel with Ziba’s; for which Ziba was deprived of his Elder and Apostleship: “Let that which was bestowed upon Ziba, be taken from him, and let him stand as a member in the Church, and let him labor with his own hands with the brethren.” And thus by commandment, poor Ziba, one of the twelve Apostles, is thrust down; while Oliver the scribe, also an Apostle, who had been guilty of similar conduct, is set on high, to prepare work for the press; and no commandment touches him, only to exalt him higher.—These two persons stated, that had they known previous to their journey to Missouri, what they then knew, they never should have accompanied Oliver thither.Sidney, since his return, has written a description of the land of Zion. But it differs essentially from that which you wrote; so much so, that either yours or his must be false. Knowing him to be constitutionally inclined to exaggerate, and suspecting that this habit would be as likely to preponderate, in his written, as in his oral communications, you cautioned him against it. “What I write will be written by the most infallible inspiration of the Holy spirit,” said he, with an air of contempt. You must be careful sir, or it will again and sound in your ears, “if he repent not” for giving a false description of the land of Zion, let him take heed lest he fall from his office. This, Sidney said, was one reason why you were not permitted to return to the State of Ohio. The want of time and paper notify me to bring this letter to a close. And now permit me to intreat you, to candidly view the whole subject, from the commencement unto the present time. Look at it with your own eyes, and no longer suffer these strangers to blind you, and daub you with their untempered mortar. Think how often you have been stumbled by those discordant revelations, false visions, and lying prophecies. Put into practice the resolutions you expressed to me the morning after the collision at the school-house, that you would go home, and attend to your own business. Transfer the lands you hold in your hands, to the persons whose money paid for it. Place yourself from under the influence of the men who have deceived you; burst the bands of delusion; and fly for your life, fly from the habitations haunted by impostors; and having done this, you most surely will be glad and rejoice, and prove to your own satisfaction, as I have done, the falsity of Joseph’s prophetic declaration, “if you turn against us you will enjoy no more satisfaction in the world.”E. B.Some things are intimated in the foregoing letter, which more properly belong to Cowdery’s mission to the Indians; and when I come to notice that mission, those things will, probably, be more fully exhibited.It is also indirectly stated, that Rigdon has acquired the habit of exaggeration. The truth of this statement, I presume, will be doubted but by few, who have been long acquainted with him. Most of his communications carry the appearance of high and false coloring; and I am persuaded, that truth by his embellishing touch, often degenerates into fiction. I have heard him several different times, give a representation of the interview between himself, and to use his own phraseology, “the far-famed Alexander Campbell.” This man’s wonted shrewdness and presence of mind, forsook him when in the presence of this gigantic Mormonite; so much so, that “he was quite confused and acted silly.” I will give you a specimen of the language, with which Rigdon said he assailed him: “You have lied Alexander. Alexander you have lied. If you do not receive the Book of Mormon you will be damned.” With such like [unreadable text] had at the feet of his chastising master. “You are a liar, you are a child of the Devil, you are an enemy to all righteousness, the spirit for the Devil is in you,” and the like, is dealt out profusely against an obstinate opponent, and especially, one whom they are pleased to nickname apostate. I regret the necessity I am under of making such statements, and could wish there had been no occasion for them. But truth compels me to it, and the good of society demands it. Yours affectionately, EZRA BOOTH
THE MORMONITES. One of this sect lately gave the following history of the origin of his religion:S. C. Journal.“A young man about 23 years of age, somewhere in Ontario county, N. Y. was visited by an angel, who informed him three times in one night, that by visiting a certain place in that town, he would have revealed to him something of importance. The young man was disturbed, but did not obey the summons until the following day, when the angel again visited him. At the place appointed, he found in the earth a box which contained a set of thin plates resembling gold, with Arabic characters inscribed on them. The plates were minutely described, as being connected rings in the shape of the letter D, which facilitated the opening and shutting of the book. The young man found in the same place two stones, with which he was enabled, by placing them over his eyes, and putting his head in a dark corner, to decipher the hieroglyphics on the plates. This was performed to admiration, and now, as the result, we have a book which is the Mormon Bible―a book second to no other―without which the Holy Bible would be of little use.”
MORMONISM. From a correspondent of the Salem Gazette, now travelling in the west.MARIETTA, (OHIO) NOV. 16, 1831. You are sensible how celebrated has become western New-York and the adjacent counties of Ohio, for their sects—their parties—their fanaticism, religious, political and anti-masonic. Their conceits are wild to the very farthest bounds of imagination. Wild in invention, and singularly successful in carrying into effect their solemn fooleries. You have heard of the Mormonites; newspapers have given detailed accounts of those fanatics, but perhaps their origin is not so well known. Mormonism is the fruit of religious excitement in this quarter, combined with roguery, ingenuity and ignorance; frequently operating successfully on those who ought to know better.The inventors of these species of fanaticism are very simple personages, and were unknown till thus brought into notice. They are old and young Joe Smith, one Harris, a farmer of New-York, and one Ringdon, a sort of preacher, from Ohio, with several other infatuated, cunning hypocrites. Old Joe Smith was once a pedlar, and possessed all that cunning shrewdness and small intrigue characteristic of that description of persons. He had a smooth tongue, was a ready story-teller, full of anecdotes he had picked up his perigrinations, and had been more fortunate in picking up materials for his tongue than for supplying his purse. He at one time set up the manufacture of gingerbread, but on the fall of the article failed in business. Young Joe was an idle, strolling, worthless fellow, although he afterwards flourished so largely in the Mormon religion. He was, however, the son of a Yankee pedlar, and brought up to live by his wits. Harris, whom I have mentioned, was considered as a substantial farmer near Palmyra, of a wild imagination, full of passages of scripture, had heard and seen much of the extravagance of the day produced by modern revival meetings, and believed fully in the wonders and miracles wrought on these occasions.The Smiths had conceived of the idea of getting rich by some short cut; the usual expedient of digging for hidden treasures was hit upon. Having heard many wonderful stories of men getting rich by digging and stumbling upon chests of money on the shores of New England, the fellow succeeded by his oratorical powers, in exciting the imagination of a few auditors, and made them so anxious to possess themselves of those hidden treasures, that at it they went with shovel and spade, excavating the ground in many places between Canandaigua Lake and Palmyra. These excavations are still to be seen in many places. They continued their labors until, at length, one of the party, tired of a laborious and unsuccessful search, spoke of a person in Ohio near Painesville, on Lake Erie, who had a wonderful facility in finding the spots where the money was hid, and how he could dream of the very spots where it was to be found. “Can we get that man here?” asked the infatuated Smiths. ‘Why,’ replied the other. “I guess as how we might by going after him; and if I had a little change to pay the expenses, I would go myself.” Away they went some to his farm, and some to his merchandise, to gain money to pay the expense of bringing the money dreamer from Ohio. The desired object was at length accomplished, and Ringdon the famous Ohio man, made his appearance. He had been a preacher of various religions, and a teacher of almost all kinds of morals. He was experienced in all sorts of camp-meetings, prayer-meetings, anxious-meetings, and revival, or four-days’ meetings. He knew every turn of the human mind relative to these matters. He had considerable talent and great plausibility. He partly united with the money-diggers in making an excavation in what has since been called the “Golden Bible Hill.”These were times and these are a people admirably suited to the promulgation of a new Bible and a new religion. Such fanatics as these were the murderers of Morgan. In such times and under such circumstances, was bread the Mormon religion.In this age of wonders, the cunning ex-preacher from Ohio suggested to the money-diggers to turn their digging concern into a religious plot. It was therefore given out that a vision had appeared to Joe Smith, that there was deposited in the hill I have mentioned an iron chest containing golden plates on which was engraved the “Book of Mormon.” These engravings were said to be in unknown characters, to all but the inspired translator, and were deposited there by a wandering tribe of the Children of Israel, before the Christian Era. It was now given out that young Joe Smith was the chosen one of God to reveal this new ministry to the world—to be the second Messiah to reveal to the world this word of life, and to reform it anew. So Joe, from being an idle, lounging fellow, became a grave, parson-like man, with a respectable looking sort of a black coat, and with the salvation of the whole world upon his shoulders. Old Joe, the ex-preacher, and several others, were the converts to the new faith, which they asserted was foretold in the Bible. But Harris was undoubtedly a true convert, and the first man who gave credit to the whole story. He was the Ali of the New York Mahomet. Ringdon the preacher knew well how to work upon the credulity of a people already excited to religious enthusiasm. His aspect was grave and contemplative, and he could quote abundance of scripture to prove his assertions. This ex-parson is no doubt the author of the book. It is full of strange narratives, in the style of the scriptures, and appears to evince some ingenuity.A fac simile of the characters on the golden plates was carried to Dr. Mitchell, by Harris. The Dr. gave some learned observations on them, but wiser heads than he were employed in the translation.—Harris raised money on a mortgage of his farm, and got the translation printed at Palmyra. The book came out to the world, and the diggers soon found they had not dug for money in vain, for by its precepts money could be raised in the twinkling from the new converts, who were daily flocking to the new standard. Another revelation now upon them. The prophets were directed to lead the way to the promised land, a place near Painesville, Ohio, and subsequently to some place on the Mississippi river, where they have adopted some of the worldly views of the Shakers, having formed a sort of community system. The roads in Trumbull county were at times crowded with these deluded wretches, with their wagons and effects, on their way to the promised land.The infatuation of these people is astonishing beyond measure. Husbands tearing themselves from their wives and such of their families as refuse to go, and wives deserting their husbands, to join the infatuated clan. A respectable physician of Trumbull county, who informed me of the latter proceedings, also informed me of several instances where the sick have died, refusing medical aid, persisting in the belief that, faith in the Mormon religion would save their lives. That he actually had been called in cases of the last extremity, where their faith had finally failed them.
For the Ohio Star. MORMONISM—NOS. VIII—IX.Nelson, Portage Co. Nov. 29, 1831.REV. & DEAR SIR— The origin of the aborigines of this country, and their history before the introduction of eastern literature into the western hemisphere, has afforded a subject for much speculation, and deep research among the learned; and has occasioned considerable curiosity among various classes of people. But the subject still remains in impenetrable obscurity; and will so remain, unless He who has the power to speak, “let there be light,’ “and light shall break forth out of obscurity.” But as this is a subject better calculated to gratify the speculative inquirer, than to purify the heart, by rectifying wrong principles in the mind, or to increase that kind of knowledge intimately connected with, and essential to practical improvements, either in civil or religious society, we may reasonably doubt, whether the Great Jehovah will soon, if ever, condescend to clear away the darkness, by giving a revelation, merely to gratify the desires of persons, who delight to wander in the region of conjecture and speculation. But he has already done it, cries the Mormonite Herald. The Book of Mormon which I hold in my hands, is a Divine Revelation, and the very thing we need, to burst the cloud and remove the darkness, which has long surrounded the mysterious and degraded aborigines. We now know that the Natives who inhabit the forest of America, are a “branch of the House of Israel;” and by the means of this blessed book, they are soon, even in this generation, to be restored to the knowledge, and the true worship of the God of Israel.—Among them is to be built the “glorious City of the New-Jerusalem,” in the midst of which is to stand, the splendid and magnificent Temple, dedicated to the Most High God, and “Oliver being called and commanded of the Lord God, to go forth among the Lamanites, to proclaim glad tidings of great joy unto them, by presenting unto them, the fulness of the Gospel of the only begotten son of God,” &c. The grand enterprise of introducing this new dispensation, or the fulness of the Gospel, among the Indian tribes, who have recently received the appellation of Lamanites, was committed in charge to Oliver Cowdery, a young man of high fame among the Mormonites.—His credentials, and the credentials of the three others associated with him in the mission, will be found in the following revelations, which I transcribe for your perusal, and also for some further remarks, which I design to offer.A REVELATION UNTO OLIVER, GIVEN SEPTEMBER, 1830Behold, I say unto you Oliver, that it shall be given thee, that thou shalt be heard by the Church in all things whatsoever thou shalt teach them by the comforter, concerning the revelations and commandments which I have given. But verily, verily, I say unto you, no one shall be appointed to receive commandments and revelations in the Church, excepting my servant Joseph, for he receiveth them even as Moses, and thou shalt be obedient unto the things which I shall given unto him, even as Aaron, to declare faithfully the commandments and the revelations, with power and authority unto the Church. And if thou art led at any time by the comforter to speak or teach, or at all times by the way of commandment unto the Church, thou may’st do it; but shalt not write by the way of commandment, but by wisdom: and thou shalt not command him who is at thy head, and at the head of the Church; for I have given him the keys of the mysteries of the revelations which are sealed, until I shall appoint unto him another in his stead.—And now behold I say unto you, that thou shalt go unto the Lamanites, and preach my Gospel unto them, and cause my Church to be established among them; and thou shalt have revelations, but write them not by the way of commandment. And now I say unto you, that it is not revealed, and no man knoweth where the City shall be built, but it shall be given hereafter. Behold, I say unto you, that it shall be among the Lamanites. Thou shalt not leave this place until after the Conference, and my servant Joseph shall be appointed to rule the Conference, by the voice of it: and what he saith unto thee that thou shalt tell. And again, thou shalt take thy brother Hiram between him and thee alone, and tell him that those things which he hath written from that stone are not of me, and that Satan hath deceived him, for these things have not been appointed unto him, neither shall any thing be appointed to any in this Church, contrary to the Church Covenant, for all things must be done in order, and by commandment, by the prayer of faith, and thou shalt settle all, these things, before thou shalt take thy journey among the Lamanites; and it shall be given from time to time, that thou shalt go, until the time that thou shalt return, what thou shalt do; and thou must open thy mouth at all times, declaring my Gospel with the sound of rejoicing.—Amen.MANCHESTER, Oct. 17, 1830.I, Oliver, being commanded of the Lord God, to go forth unto the Lamanites, to proclaim glad tidings of great joy unto them, by presenting unto them the fulness of the Gospel, of the only begotten son of God; and also, to rear up a pillar as a witness where the Temple of God shall be built, in the glorious New-Jerusalem; and having certain brothers with me, who are called of God to assist me, whose names are Parley, Peter and Ziba, do therefore most solemnly covenant before God, that I will walk humbly before him, and do this business, and this glorious work according as he shall direct me by the Holy Ghost; ever praying for mine and their prosperity, and deliverance from bonds, and from imprisonments, and whatsoever may befal us, with all patience and faith.—Amen.OLIVER COWDERY.We, the undersigned, being called and commanded of the Lord God, to accompany our Brother Oliver Cowdery, to go to the Lamanites, and to assist in the above mentioned glorious work and business. We do, therefore, most solemnly covenant before God, that we will assist him faithfully in this thing, by giving heed unto all his words and advice, which is, or shall be given him by the spirit of truth, ever praying with all prayer and supplication, for our and his prosperity, and our deliverance from bonds, and imprisonments, and whatsoever may come upon us, with all patience and faith.—Amen. Signed in presence of JOSEPH SMITH, Jun.DAVID WHITMER, P. P. PRATT,Z IBA PETERSON, PETER WHITMER. In the preceding revelation, the principal thing which claims your attention, is the mission to the Indians; for with that mission many circumstances are connected, which clearly evince, that it originated from human imbecility, and diabolical depravity. — There are also some other things, the meaning of which, you will not be likely to apprehend, without some explanation. In this, as well as several of the commandments, it is clearly and explicitly stated, that the right of delivering written commandments, and revelations, belong exclusively to Smith, and no other person can interfere, without being guilty of sacrilege. In this office he is to stand, until another is appointed in his place, and no other person can be appointed in his stead, unless he falls through transgression; and in such a case, he himself is authorized to appoint his successor. But how is he to be detected, should he become guilty of transgression. The commandment makes provision for this. His guilt will become manifest by his inability to utter any more revelations, and should he presume “to get another man’s wife,” and commit adultery; and “by the shedding of blood, seek to kill her husband,” if he retains the use of his tongue, so as to be able to utter his jargon, he can continue as long as he pleases in the bed of adultery, and wrap himself with garments stained with blood, shed by his own hands, and still retain the spotless innocence of the holiest among mortals; and must be continued in the office of revelator, and head of the Church. Some others, and especially Cowdery, have earnestly desired to relieve Smith of some part of his burden. Cowdery’s desires for this work were so keen and excessive, as, to use his own language, it “was unto me as a burning fire shut up in my bones, and I was weary with forbearing, and I could forbear no longer;” and he did in fact, issue some productions, which he said bore the Divine impress; but Smith fixed upon them the stamp of devilish. But it seems, in order to compromise the matter, that Cowdery was permitted to “speak or to teach, at all times, by the way of commandment unto the Church: but not to write them by the way of commandment;” thus Cowdery is authorized to give verbal commandments to the Church, by the inspiration of the spirit, which, if he afterwards writes, ceases to be inspiration; therefore, a commandment delivered orally, may be divinely inspired; but the same communicated, written verbatim, so far loses its former character, that it degenerates into a production of an infernal stamp. Here is a mystery, for aught I know, peculiar to Mormonism; and none but Mormonites, I presume, will attempt to unravel it. But it finds its parallel in the following. Smith assures his followers, that what he speaks by the spirit, and is written, is infallible in operation, but if it isnot written, he may sometimes be mistaken.—He tells them, that the right to deliver written revelations, belongs exclusively to himself, and no other person shall interfere in the business; and if he transgresses, he will graciously condescend to appoint another in his stead, and the only proof produced for the support of such assertions, is barely his word upon which they implicitly rely, and become entirely resigned to place their person and property under his control, and even to risk the salvation of their souls upon his say-so. Such glaring duplicity on the one hand, and unaccountable credulity on the other, seldom have a parallel in the annals of man.Never was there a despot more jealous of his perogatives than Smith; and never was a fortress guarded with more vigilance and ardor, against every invading foe, than he guards these. Smith apprehended a revival in the department of written inspiration, from another quarter, and hence Cowdery was commissioned to commence an attack, and suppress the enemy, before he had acquired sufficient stability and strength, so as to become formidable. “Thou shalt take thy brother Hiram between him and thee alone, and tell him the things he hath written from that stone,” &c. Hiram Page, one of the eight witnesses, and also one of the “money diggers,” found a smooth stone, upon which there appeared to be writing, which when transcribed upon paper, disappeared from the stone, and another impression appeared in its place. This when copied, vanished as the former had done, and so it continued alternately appearing and disappearing; in the meanwhile, he continued to write, until he had written over considerable paper. It bore most striking marks of a Mormonite revelation, and was received as an authentic document by most of the Mormonites, till Smith, by his superior sagacity, discovered it to be a Satanic fraud.A female, professing to be a prophetess, made her appearance in Kirtland, and so ingratiated herself into the esteem and favor of some of the Elders, that they received her, as a person commissioned to act a conspicuous part in Mormonizing the world. Rigdon, and some others, gave her the right hand of fellowship, and literally saluted her with what they called the kiss of charity. But Smith viewing her as encroaching upon his sacred premises, declared her an impostor, and she returned to the place from whence she came. Her visit, however, made a deep impression on the minds of many, and the barbed arrow which she left in the hearts of some, is not as yet eradicated. Yours affectionately, REV. I. EDDY.  EZRA BOOTH
TO THE PUBLIC The Lord willing, I will deliver a Lecture on the Christian Religion, in the village of Ravenna, on Sunday, the 25th inst. at the brick school house, or at the school house owned by Dr. De Wolf.I also give notice to EZRA BOOTH, that his attendance is desired, as I shall review the letters written by him and published in the Ohio Star, headed Mormonism, as those letters are an unfair and false representation of the subjects on which they treat. Should it not be convenient to review them on Sunday, I shall review them the day following, if a place can be provided for that purpose by the citizens of Ravenna; or at any time or place where it may be thought most convenient for all concerned.SIDNEY RIGDON.TO SIMONS RIDER:Sir—As you have publicly declared the book of Mormon to be an imposition, and I believing it to be otherwise, at present, deeming it my privilege to know it as well as you, do hereby present a request to you to meet me in the township of Hiram, Portage county, at such time and place as may be agreed upon hereafter, to investigate this subject, before the public, that if I am deluded in receiving this book as a revelation from God, I may be corrected, and the public relieved from anxiety. Your acceptance or rejection of this request, is desired through the medium of the Ohio Star. SIDNEY RIGDON. 
Nelson, Portage Co. Dec. 6, 1831 REV. & DEAR SIR— In this letter the mission to the Indians will be brought into view, and with it, are connected circumstances and facts, sufficient, one would suppose, to convince every honest and unprejudiced Mormonite, of the fallacy and deception of Mormonism. But a Mormonite of the highest grade, is invulnerable, by facts the most notorious, and evidence, as glaring as the noon-day sun; for they affirm, they know by the spirit that Mormonism is what it pretends to be; and should Smith acknowledge it to be a fabrication, they would not believe him. This forms the highest climax in Mormonism, and but few have attained to it. After Cowdery, and his three associates had left the state of N. Y. while bending their course to the west, he was directed by the spirit to Kirtland, for the special purpose of enlisting Rigdon in the Mormonite cause. I have since learned, that the spirit which directed in this enterprize, was no other than Pratt, who had previously become acquainted with Rigdon, and had been proselyted by him into what is called the Campbellite faith. This new system appears to have been particularly suited to Rigdon’s taste, and calculated to make an impression on his mind. But before he could fully embrace it, he must “receive a testimony from God.” In order to do this, he labored as he was directed by his Preceptor, almost incessantly and earnestly in praying, till at length, his mind was wrapped up in a vision; and to use his own language, “to my astonishment I saw the different orders of professing Christians passing before my eyes, with their hearts exposed to view, and they were as corrupt as corruption itself. That society to which I belonged also passed before my eyes, and to my astonishment, it was as corrupt as the others. Last of all that little man who brought me the Book of Mormon, passed before my eyes with his heart open, and it was as pure as an angel: and this was a testimony from God, that the Book of Mormon was a Divine Revelation.” Rigdon is one who has ascended to the summit of Mormonisn; and this vision stands as the foundation of his knowledge. He frequently affirms, that these things are not a matter of faith with him, but of absolute knowledge. He has been favored with many extraordinary visions, in some of which he saw Kirtland with the surrounding country, consecrated as the promised land, and the Churches in the state of N. Y. expected to received their everlasting inheritance in the state of Ohio, and this expectation was grounded upon Rigdon’s visions, while he was in the state of N. Y. These visions are considered by the Church as entitled to no credit, and laid aside as mere rubbish.As it relates to the purity of the heart of “that little man,” if a pure and pleasant fountain can send forth corrupt and bitter streams, then may the heart of that man be pure, who enters into a matrimonial contract with a young lady, and obtains the consent of her parents; but as soon as his back is turned upon her, he violates his engagements, and prostitutes his honor by becoming the gallant of another, and resolves in his heart, and expresses resolutions to marry her. But as the practice of a man will ever stand as a general criterion by which the principles of the heart are to be tested, we say, that the heart of such a man is the reverse of purity.From Kirtland, Cowdery & Co. were directed by the spirit to Sandusky, where they contemplated opening their mission, and proselyting the Indians residing at that place. But neither Cowdery, nor the spirit which directed him, was able to open the way to, or make any impressions upon their minds. Being frustrated in this, his first attempt to convert the Natives, he turned his attention and course to Missouri, and when near the eastern line of that state, he halted for several days, for the purpose of obtaining, by inquiry, information respecting the Indians, still further to the West. It appears that he was fearful that his infallible guide, (the spirit,) was incapable to direct him, while proceeding further to the west; consequently, he applied to men more capable of giving instruction than the spirit, by which he was influenced. When he arrived at the western line of Missouri, he passed it into the Indian territory, where he continued but a short time, before he was notified by the U. S. agent, that he must either re-pass the line, or be compelled to take his residence in the garrison, forty miles up the Arkansas river. As there was no other alternative, the former seemed to him the most expedient; and he never possessed courage sufficient to pass the line, or visit the residence of the Indians since. Thus you behold a man, “called and commanded of the Lord God, to go forth unto the Lamanites,” and establish his Church among them; but no sooner is he set down in the field of his mission, and surrounded by his anticipated converts, than he is driven by a comparative nothing, from the field, and obliged to relinquish his contemplated harvest.—This is the person commissioned by the Lord to prostrate the western wilds, and as he himself stated, “to the place where the foot of a white man never trod,” to rear up a pillar for a witness, where the Temple of God shall be built in the glorious New-Jerusalem.” But alas! he was arrested by man in his course, and by the breath of man the mighty undertaking was blown into the air, and Cowdery was thrown back among the Gentiles, to wait for the spirit to devise some new plans in the place of those which had been frustrated. But as a City and a Temple must be built, as every avenue leading to the Indians was closed against the Mormonites, it was thought that they should be built among the Gentiles, which is in direct opposition to the original plan—as foreign from the design of the spirit, expressed in several commandments, as it would have been, had the Directors, who were appointed to build the Courthouse in Ravenna, buil it in Trumbull county, foreign from the design of those who entrusted them with the business.Though their plans had hitherto failed, they were unwilling to abandon the Indian enterprize; and in a commandment it was stated, that Cowdery and others should receive a written recommendation, signed by the Elders, for the purpose of presenting it to the Indian agent, in order to obtain permission from him, to visit the Indians in their settlements. The recommendation was written according to commandment, and frequent opportunities occurred in which it might have been presented to the agent, but it never was presented, and of course was useless, he was censured by some for not presenting it, but I suppose the spirit directed him not to do it. Another method has been invented, in order to remove obstacles which hitherto have proved insurmountable. “The Lord’s store-house,” is to be furnished with goods suited to the Indian trade, and persons are to obtain license from the government to dispose of them to the Indians in their own territory; at the same time, they are to disseminate the principles of Mormonism among them. From this smugling method of preaching to the Indians, they anticipate a favorable result. In addition to this, and to co-operate with it, it has been made known by revelation, that it will be pleasing to the Lord, should they form a matrimonial alliance with the Natives; and by this means the Elders, who comply with the thing so pleasing to the Lord, and for which the Lord has promised to bless those who do it abundantly, gain a residence in the Indian territory, independent of the agent. It has been made known to one, who has left his wife in the state of N. Y. that he is entirely free from his wife, and he is at liberty to take him a wife from among the Lamanites. It was easily perceived that this permission, was perfectly suited to his desires. I have frequently heard him state, that the Lord has made it known to him, that he is as free from his wife as from any other woman; and the only crime that I have ever heard alleged against her is, she is violently opposed to Mormonism. But before this contemplated marriage can be carried into effect, he must return to the state of N. Y. and settle his business, for fear, should he return, after that affair had taken place, the civil authority would apprehend him as a criminal. It is with pleasure I close this exposition, having in part accomplished, what I intended when I commenced it. The employment has been an unpleasant one to me, and from the first, I should have gladly avoided it, could I have done it, and maintained a conscience void of offence, towards God and man.—But should an individual by this exposition, be extricated or prevented from falling into the delusion, which has been the subject of consideration, I shall be amply compensated, for the painful task which I have performed.Yours affectionately,REV. I. EDDY.EZRA BOOTH.
Sidney Rigdon, the vicegerant and champion of Jo. Smith, has thrown out a challenge, in the Ohio Star, to Mr. Booth and Deacon Rider, who have renounced the Mormon faith, to meet him in mortal combat (of words) on the subject of the Gold Bible. The courage of the gentleman has probably received some new impetus since he challenged the whole world to disprove the truth of his new bible, and on being taken up by Elder Campbell, with his wonted impudence refused to meet him.
For the Ohio Star.MR. EDITOR— Sir, I noticed in your paper of the 15th inst. a challenge from Sidney Rigdon, directed to me, to meet him in Hiram, Portage county, for the purpose of investigating the subject of Mormonism, before the public, that if he is deluded, to be corrected, and the public relieved from anxiety.That Mormonism is a base imposition I most certainly believe, notwithstanding the apparent honest and pretended great faith of its proclaimers; and that it is Sidney Rigdon’s privilege to know as much about it as I do, is undoubtedly a truth. Now if he really is anxious that I should teach him the truth, and correct his errors, it does appear to me that a private interview would be much more convenient and much more to his profit, as our dwellings are about sixty rods apart; and if he is honestly disposed to place himself under my tuition, he shall be tenderly used, and such care taken of him as his peculiar condition would seem to justify. But to undertake to correct him of his errors before the public, would be a most arduous task for me. His irascible temper, loquacious extravagance, impaired state of mind, and want of due respect to his superiors, I fear would render him in such a place, unmanageable, and I therefore fail of accomplishing the desired object.As it respects the public anxiety in Hiram and its vicinity, relative to Mormonism, it has long since been relieved, except a few cases of seceding Mormons, and they appear to be fast recovering from their mental derangement, and bid fair again to become useful members of society. Therefore, an investigation of this subject, before the public, for their benefit, would be in a great measure if not altogether, void of utility. Furthermore, Sidney Rigdon and his colleagues have labored both in public and in private, to their utmost, in and about Hiram, since their return from the Missouri, to save, if possible, a sinking cause, but without much success, for the people generally have left their meetings, except a few of their remaining brotherhood, which to me makes Sidney Rigdon’s challenge appear more like one of the throes of expiring Mormonism, to cause, if possible, “public anxiety” in this place, than the spontaneous prodcution of an honest heart.I have before me the Telegraph, published at Painesville, under date of 15th February last, in which is an account that Sidney Rigdon gave a public challenge, in a public meeting held at Kirtland, in which he defied the world to refute the divine pretensions of the Book of Mormon. Accordingly, Elder Thomas Campbell, whose venerable age, standing in society, and profound erudition, should have commanded his respect, accepted his challenge, and in a very polite and friendly manner sent him written notice to that effect. One the receipt of the note, he committed it to the flames, without even once reading except a few lines. If he then with all his professed meekness and humility would thus treat venerable age, what may a young man now expect at his hands?The following is a copy of a commandment,* placed in my possession by David Whitmer, one of the three witnesses to the book of Mormon, which will show the great importance of Sidney Rigdon, as viewed by Mormons: for the commandments are not only represented by the heads of department, but they represent themselves as being revelations directly from Jesus Christ, through Joseph Smith, Jr., and of equal authority with the book of Mormon.—Now the biography of Sidney Rigdon, together with the history of Mormonism since their first appearance on this Reserve, will go abundantly to prove to any superficial observer that this commandment never originated form an infinite mind. But to disbelieve one commandment, says the Mormon, is equivalent to denying the whole. Thus you see, Mr. Editor, if a man once opens his heart to receive the book of Mormon as a divine record, he is also under the necessity of receiving whatever Joseph Smith, Jr. is pleased to proscribe by way of commandment, however ridiculous and absurd, or else turn back, as they say, to the weak and beggarly elements of this world, and thereby incur the displeasure of the author of their being.SYMONDS RYDER.*This Commandment is necessarily deferred. —Ed.
To the State of Ohio, I desired to go, however: from other considerations than this. A very singular people (both of origin and practice,) had attracted my attention: whose particular place of gathering, at this time, was there. I had heard much of the people: and in many places, the excitement I found considerably in their favor; but many were halting between two opinions, respecting them; and wishing to be informed. What I had learned, I imagined, if real, was of no small moment, either to myself or others. But if not, the things should be duly investigated, (even of such as were skilled to discern,) and exposed as a warning to those, who were liable to founder, upon the same quicksands. My first impression of them, was, that they were a deluded people; [137] and their writings, were a long time at my side, before I thought them worthy of my notice—Wherefore, on seeing some of my acquaintance, if an error, carried away of that error; I began to think it high time, to look into the things, and to know for myself, what that error was.Accordingly I took the steam-boat in company with Elizabeth, and we traveled down the Lake, and landed at Painesville, (Ohio.) From thence we went directly to Kirtland, where we met with the people, referred to above; and were entertained of E. Marsh, from the city of Boston. Just as we reached the place, (which appeared providential,) all of their chief Elders arrived home: so that we had every opportunity of informing ourselves respecting them, which was desirable. As there are few, comparatively, who have had any knowledge of the Sect, so recently arisen, I will here take the liberty to subjoin some brief hints, in regard to, both them, and their persuasion.A young man by the name of Smith, is the principal among them; who was trained, in the State of New York; and is now, about 28 years of age. He professes, about four years since, to have seen, and held communion with, an angel from God. That he was lying upon his bed, at a certain time, (having just been reclaimed from a back-slidden state) and the room, of a sudden, became light as day—when a beautiful person, presented himself, who required that he, (Mr. S.) should go to such a place; as he had something wonderful, he wished to reveal. He accordingly went; and was directed by the angel to a certain spot of ground, where was deposited a “Box”—[138] and in that box contained “Plates,” which resembled gold; also, a pair of “interpreters,” (as he called them,) that resembled spectacles; by looking into which, he could read a writing engraven upon the plates, though to himself, in a tongue unknown. These were delivered to him, as he asserts, to publish to the world. And when the things were committed to paper, “the box, &c. were to be sealed up, and deposited in the earth, from whence they were taken.”All these things, he moreover, professes to have done; (though with the assistance of others, being himself, an illiterate youth,) and that the box, according to commandment, is sealed up, and to be seen of him, no more. The Book, consequently, taken from the plates, is regarded as the “Word of Inspiration:” and which contains the names of a considerable number of witnesses; that had been since esteemed, men of both intelligence, and veracity.That book, I have both seen, and read—which is very voluminous. It pretends, for itself, to shew—by whom, and at what period, it was concealed in the rock. “By Jews,” according to its own testimony, “of the ten tribes of Israel, in the 5th century, of the Christian Era.—Who for liberty of conscience, left the Old Word in a ship of their own construction; and sailed over the ‘Great Waters,’ they knew not whither, until they reached land:—and that, a number of centuries, anterior to the day of Christ. It shews, furthermore, what darkness prevailed over all the country! how the earth shook,—and what strange phenomenon, was represented to [139] many, on the day the Son of God was crucified! It also shews, that from the wickedness of some tribes, how their complexion became changed; and how the ‘God Book,’ came to be lost, from among them. It foretells their fall; also, how long, and they shall rise again; and that their end, will then be great, till ‘time’ shall be, no more.”The Book enjoins, 1st, “Baptism, by emersion, as a condition of acceptance with God:”—(which they consider, an acknowledgment of faith, in His Inspired Word: and a “being born again of water, and of the Spirit.”) Hence, such only, as yield submission to this ordinance, and assent to the things contained in the Book, are with them, the avowed subjects of the kingdom of grace; and the favourites of Heaven.It inculcates, 2dly, “That every such member, shall come out from the world: forsake father, mother, wife and children; nor call aught of his possessions, his own.” Hence, they are to embody themselves together, at some particular place; “have all things common;” and so live together, in love; as the peculiar people, and the household, of the Lord Jesus Christ.It enjoins, 3dly, “That every distinct member, be found at the Lord’s Table every Sabbathday, to commemorate His death and sufferings until He come;—and, moreover, that such, ‘exercise faith in God, of working miracles;’ according to the attainment of the primitive disciples: viz. of healing the sick, raising the dead, casting out devils, and of imparting the Holy Ghost, by the laying on of hands, &c. (To the faith of the Apos-[140]tles, some of them, profess already to have attained; particularly Mr. S. whom they call their “Seer.” He could do, many wonderful things.They believe, according to the Book: “That a day of great wrath, is bursting upon all the kindreds of the earth; and that, in Mount Zion, and in Jerusalem, alone, shall be deliverance in that day,” even in the land, which the Lord Jesus had given to them, for a dwelling-place, and an everlasting possession.) The place where they then had their stay, was not the “Land ofPromise;” but that, lay, on the western boundary of the State of Missouri. In which place, they were then assembling; and where they believed that in process of time, they should have a temple; and a city, of great magnificence, and wealth; and that shortly, they should increase, and tread down all their enemies, and bruise them beneath their feet. After which period, Christ Jesus should descend, and reign with them, personally, 1000 years upon the earth. And then their enemies should be loosed for a season, (or, as one said to me, for the space of three months,) when, should take place, the General Judgment; and the final consummation of all created things.”These things, accordingly, they had prevailed on some thousands to believe. Of their numbers, I found, ministers, of different persuasions: and some, it appeared, who had once been eminent for piety. I found, also, many men, of both influence and wealth. Husbands, who had left their wives: and wives, that had left their husbands.—Children, that had left their parents: and parents, their children,—that they might be “accounted [141] worthy,” as they said, “to escape all the things that should come to pass; and to stand before the Son of Man.”On the evening that we arrived, they had a meeting for searching hearts; which we, were too weary, to attend. The next day, which was the Sabbath, we had the privilege of going to hear them; but they allowed us to say nothing. We were present, at their communion season; also by the river side, where the ordinance of baptism, was administered. Thus, through all their exercises, I had followed them for one day, with the strictest scrutiny, and I wished to be away. I had travelled the world extensively; and had a chance of visiting some, of almost every religious 
For the Ohio Star. TO THE PUBLIC. Having a few weeks since, through the medium of the “Ohio Star,” invited SIMONS RIDER to meet me and investigate the divine authenticity of the book of Mormon, with which he pretended to have an intimate acquaintance, and which he had pronounced an imposition; willing to acknowledge every man to be honest, and sincere, till I have evidence to the contrary, so I was willing to receive Simons Rider in the character which he claimed; but how far myself or the public are bound to receive him as an honest man, I leave his letter written in reply to my request to testify. If Simons Rider is afraid to have his assertions put to the test, why make them? If he is certain (as he pretends) that the book of Mormon is a “base imposition,” why be afraid to come forward and prove it? I say—where is honesty?—where is candor? surely, not in the heart of such a man. Am I to blame for drawing this conclusion? surely not, for he has forced it upon me. He presented himself before the public as an accuser; he has been called upon before the same public, to support his accusations; and does he come forward and do it? nay, but seeks to hide himself behind a battery of reproach, and abuse, and low insinuation. He would fain make the public believe in meeting me to investigate the truth of his accusations, that all the evils of Pandora’s box would be poured out on his head. The words of the Savior of the world are verified in this instance—“He that doeth evil hateth the light, neither cometh to the light, lest his deeds should be made manifest,” &c.Simons, like the worker of iniquity, has sought a hiding place. Let the public remember, when he goes forth again to proclaim his anathemas against the book of Mormon, that he has been invited upon honorable principles to investigate its merits, and dare not do it. This is a matter of his own bringing forth; he is at liberty to believe as he pleases, and I am the last one who would treat him unbecomingly on account of it; but Simons was not contented with this privilege; but sought to raise himself at the expense of others, (as his conduct manifests to every man of candor,) he stept forward, and made an attempt to go alone, and thought at the first step to put his heel upon his neighbor’s neck; but I have seen proper to set him back again; and let him now seek some one to help him until he learns to ponder the path of his feet.He who is afraid to have his assertions put to the test, let him cease to make them. He who dares not defend his charges gratuitously made against his neighbor’s religion when called upon, will do well to set himself down in his own house, and tell the people, if you will bring your preaching to my house I will do it for you—I will investigate privately, but do not bring me before the public. So is Simon’s conduct; and there I leave him, for the present.SIDNEY RIGDON.Hiram, Portage County, Ohio, Jan. 6, 1832.
CHANGES OF MORMONISM. In a postscript to a letter recently received from Chagrin River, Ohio, the writer says:“The Mormonites in this region have received a ‘new revelation’ which has been proclaimed through the medium of their seer, Jo Smith. viz.—‘that the whole human family will finally be brought to a knowledge of the truth and be saved.’ They have in some instances gone to those on whom they had pronounced curses for their unbelief, and asked forgiveness—proclaiming the new revelation, and stating that ‘their want of charity for unbelievers originated from the same cause that misled the Jews in the days of our Saviour.’”J.M.H.In view of the above every friend of Universalism and well wisher to our cause, will be ready to exclaim, “‘Good Lord deliver us’ from such accessions to our ranks as the Mormonites.” They have hitherto attempted to honor Orhodoxy by teaching the doctrine of endless misery; we hope they will not now seek to disgrace Universalism by professing faith in the salvation of all men. We have this reflection, however, to console us, that if they embrace and teach Universalism they must renounce Mormonism and the pretended revelations they have received from Jo Smith, for this plain reason—the Mormon Bible written by him teaches endless damnation in the most plain and unequivocal language; and of course, that revelation must be given up. S.
THE ORATORS OF MORMON.MR. PRINTER— As the press is a medium through which to communicate information for public use, I have sent the following for that purpose.B. STOKELYOn Wednesday, the 8th of this month, two strangers called at my house and stated that they were sent by God to preach the gospel to every creature and said if a number should be convened they would deliver a discourse. On the question, what is your profession? they answered, the world call us Mormonites: this excited my curiosity, and at early candle light they commenced an address to the people convened. The substance for which I took down while they were speaking, and afterwards in conversation.“We are commanded by the Lord to declare his will to effect his intended purpose.—In 1827 a young man called Joseph Smith of the state of New York, of no denomination, but under conviction, inquired of the Lord what he should do to be saved—he went to bed without any reply, but in the night was awakened by an angel, whiter and shining in greater splendour than the sun at noonday, who gave information where the plates were deposited:—Smith awoke, and after due preparation and agreeably to the information given by the angel, he went into the township of Manchester, and there, on the side of a hill, found in a stone box, or a square space enclosed by stone on every side, the plates on which the revelation was inscribed. The box in thickness was about 6 inches, and about 7 by 5 otherwise; the plates themselves were about as thick as window glass, or common tin, pure gold, and well secured by silver rings or loops in the box as an effectual defence against all weather. Smith, being entirely ignorant of any language but the English, and knowing that itself in a very imperfect manner, was unable to read or decypher a single word—he therefore sent the plates to the city of New York to be translated by Professor Anthony, who could make nothing of them;—here seemed to be an insurmountable difficulty.It was supposed that the language of the plates was Arabic, Chaldean, and Egyptian; but God by his goodness inspired Smith himself to translate the whole.—Smith, however, not being qualified to write, employed an amanuensis, who wrote for him—they thus translated about two thirds of what the plates contained, reserving the residue for a future day as the Lord might hereafter direct. Six hundred years before Christ a certain prophet called Lehi went out to declare and promulgate the prophecies to come; he came across the water into South America, who with others, went to Jerusalem: but there they were divided into two parties; one wise, the other foolish; the latter were therefore cursed with yellow skins; which is supposed to mean the Indians of the Rocky Mountains.—In 500 years before Christ the wise ones gave a sign, or was to give one, that there shall be a total darkness two days and one night, but the people refused to take warning; and when Jerusalem was destroyed, the righteous were saved—all the teaching of the Mormonites is comprised in this book (their Bible) price one dollar twenty five cents. The greater part of the people were converted for a time, but were again divided and destroyed 400 years after Christ. The last battle that was fought among these parties was on the very groundwhere the plates were found, but it had been a running battle, for they commenced at the Isthmus of Darien and ended at Manchester.—The plates state that we shall drive back the Indians to the South and West: with a promise, however, to be brought back in the fulness of time; and all the unbeliefs existing can never prevent these prophecies from fulfilment. Iniquity will shortly be swept from the Earth.—Smith, when required by the Lord to translate, read, and publish the plates, excused himself as being unlearned, and could not even read.The use of the Mormonite Bible is to connect and fulfil the prophecies of Isaiah; it comesalso to fulfil the Scriptures and to restore the house of Israel to their lawful rights. The servants of this religion will fish and hunt up Israel and put them into possession of their promised land (The speaker) himself is specially commanded to go forth and warn the people to flee from the wrath to come—were it not for this injunction he would rather work at the hardest labor.—They have gone forth like the disciples of old, without money or scrip, taking no thought what they shall say—and when they are not well received, shake off the dust of their feet as a testimony against the people who thus reject the Holy Spirit. He has left Father, Mother, Brothers and Sisters, the farm and neighborhood of friends, to declare the will of God, and the revelation ofJohn who saw the angel flying through Heaven—An angel brought the Mormonite Bible and laid it before him (the speaker;) he therefore knows these things to be true. Being sent to call on all to repent—he has come to fulfil the commands of Heaven: he has cleared his skirts of our blood.”I have made some remarks, and given a few particular traits from the Mormon bible “Christ appeared to 3000 and they all put their hands into his side and believed.” (What a host of Thomases.) The books of this Bible are in number 14, under the following names, viz; 1 Nephi, 2 Nephi, Books of Jacob, Enos, Jarem, Omni, Mormon, Mesiah, Almo, Nephi, jr., Mormon, (again,) Ether, and Morni—translated by Joseph Smith, junior, by pure inspiration—certified to be true by Oliver Cowdry, David Whitmer and Martin Harris, who declare, “That an angel of God came from heaven and brought the plates and laid them before your eyes and we beheld and saw the plates.”—Another certificate is added, signed by eight more, viz: Christian Whitmer, Jacob Whitmer, Peter Whitmer, jr, John Whitmer, Hiram Page, Joseph Smith, senr. Hiram Smith, and Saml H. Smith, who declare that J Smith, jr., laid the plates before them, to the truth of which they certify.—One of the young men called himself Lyman Johnston, from Portage County, Ohio. The other was called Arson Pratt; no fixed place of abode. They were going North East, intending to preach the gospel to every kindred, tongue and nation:—They appeared to have very little learning, to be sincere in all they said. They had good manners—had been well raised—were decent and unassuming in every thing I saw, or heard them say. They said what I could hardly believe; “that John the Revelator was yet alive and about in the world.” I thought for certain he had been dead for more than fifty years, and observed that I should be glad to see the old man; to which they made no reply—Arson Pratt repeating his reluctance to an initerant life and (but for the mandate of God) he had rather work at any thing else however hard. I observed perhaps on application he could compromise with Providence get another in his place, and he himself locate—he made no reply. Mercer Press
Mormonism.The present is a period teeming with circumstances every way ominous of approaching changes or revolutions, important probably both to church and state.Among others, Mormonism is a subject that demands the attention of every Christian philanthropist, inasmuch as it already boasts of hundreds of converts, and threatens the destruction of thousands.I am confident that the annals of history do not afford a plot so deeply laid, and so cunningly formed as this; for its deception and wickedness are so completely covered by sanctimonious appearances, that many an honest man and undoubtedly honest Christan, has been led away by it.Some from almost all the denominations have fallen in with it, especially from the Free Baptist. And it is astonishing, that a subject of this nature, should be treated with so much indifference as this that I know of, have written any things against it.Perhaps this apparent indifference may be attributed to the want of information; or to mistaken views of the subject, such as I entertained when at Manchester the winter the plates were found. It was looked upon at the time as altogether unworthy of notice; and there were none, perhaps, that could have been made to believe that twenty persons in the United States could be so exceedingly duped, as hundreds are at present. But from the success they have already met with, it seems difficult to calculate the final result.From a careful perusal of their book, and from personal observation, as I live among them, I have collected a number of facts and circumstances, which may be of some use if published to the world; at least they may lead to an investigation of the subject before it is embraces, which will be more than nine tenths of those who have already embraced it, have done. I have conversed with some, who said that they never saw the book until after they joined the society; others say they never read three pages before they became members; and I have not yet found one, either among privates or preachers, who has read the book through.This way of making converts corresponds with an article in a late revelation, which was intended apparently as an amendment of the first; in which they are prohibited from revealing the secrets of the kingdom to the world, or even to their own members until they become strong in the faith.The principles on which they build are, 1. God is about to introduce the millenium, and gather his ancient people. 2. The Bible was not intended as a perfect revelation, and is insufficient to bring about this work; in consequence of this imperfection, the present professors of religion are in darkness and corruption, and must all be damned unless they embrace Mormonism. 3. God has given us Jo Smith as a prophet, with the book which contains the revelation, and has promised revelation upon revelation to perform this great work.Agreeably to the above proposition, Smith’s word to them is the word of God; and it is astonishing to see the confidence they place in it. As they are taught that the world, together with all professors of religion, are emnity with God and truth; they are perfectly deaf to all reason that is against them, however consistent it may be.It will be seen from the above, that Smith has secured the right of revealing any thing which he deems necessary. This was a good hit for him, as will be seen by the following.At their commencement, they pretended to heal the sick, and perform many other miracles; but failing in many attempts, Smith saw it necessary that some way should be devised to continue the deception of his credulous followers; consequently he produced the following revelation:—“And again it shall come to pass that he that hath faith in me to be healed, andis not appointed unto death, shall be healed; he that hath faith to see shall see; and he that hath faith to hear shall hear.”As to their miracles, I am prepared to say, that in this church, (which consists of 60 or 70 members, as I am informed, and among whom I reside,) there has nothing taken place which has the least appearance of a miracle, so far as I have had opportunity of examining. They laid their hands on one man in this vicinity and pronounced him healed, but two of three days after this he died. When this took place they concluded he was appointed unto death. This is a specimen of all the miracles that have come under my observation.They are all preparing to go to the promised lands, as they call it, where the new Jerusalem is to be built. This land is in the Missouri Territory. Many have already gone. Ten left this church last week for that country; and the remainder, or most of the church, are preparing to go in June next.This short sketch will give your readers some idea of the rise and character ofMormonism, if they have not had the information before; and I intend, in my subsequent communications, to give them the additional revelation or law, to which I have referred, together with an examination of the book of Mormon, being confident that it contains such egregious errors and inconsistencies, as must utterly overthrow it in the mind of every rational person.
From the Rock Spring (Illinois) Pioneer. MORMONISM. Some days since several Mormonite preachers, in their perigrinations, passed through this and the adjoining counties. In St. Clair not much impression was made. One preached in Lebanon, 4 miles from us. In Madison county, on the Ridge Praire, a few miles south of Edwardsville, they were more successful in making “Impressions.” Several families, Methodist, Baptists, and others, were ‘almost persuaded.’ We believe all have been cured of this singular fanaticism but one family. A Mr. McMahan, a pious and respectable man, & a Methodist local preacher, was so bewildered with their new bible, and their power to work miracles, as to follow them to Shoal creek where he got baptised into the Mormon faith, and received from them a commission to preach and work miracles in turn. After one or two ineffectual attempts with his neighbors, he became entirely deranged in which exercise his wife soon joined. Under the notion that they were fighting evil spirits, they commenced a frenzied attack on their house and furniture. They soon demolished a valuable time piece, a new high post beadstead, bureau, chairs, &c. and tore off the weather boarding, and broke the windows of the house. The next protect was to “sacrifice” one of their children, but were interrupted by one of the neighbors interfering, who was obliged to confine this promising disciple of Mormonism in irons till he become more peaceable. He is now suffered to go at large, though still laboring under mental alienation. His wife is some better.These sudden and apparently providential ‘effects’ of Mormon faith, has put a stop to further proselyting in this quarter. We hope the people hereafter will be satisfied with the Bible God has given us, and the religion it reveals, without the addition of the “Book of Mormon.”
Mormonism. – On Thursday evening last, our citizens were invited to attend a meeting in the Town Hall, to hear one of the believers in theBook of Mormon relate the remarkable events which brought this new sect into existence. The Hall was filled at early candle light, with a highly respectable audience, as might have been anticipated from the novelty of the occasion. The speaker commenced in the usual manner of conducting religious meetings—with prayer—after which he proceeded to inform his audience, that a very important revelation had recently been made by an angel from Heaven, found inscribed on metalic plates—and which related to the history of the lost tribe of the house of Israel: and that the time had now arrived for the gathering of the true believers to Mount Zion, the city of the saint’s solemnity, which is located, agreeably to this revelation, in some part of the State of Missouri.—Lynn (Mass.)

MORMONISM. We have not heretofore thought in necessary to occupy our columns with the rise and progress of this singular delusion. But we understand its abettors are sending out their agents, and actually making proselytes in different parts of the country. And therefore we have concluded to give a brief account of the matter. The leaders of the affair claim to have been selected as the medium of a new revelation from heaven. The Lockport, N.Y. Balance, published in the vicinity where it first begun, has given a brief account of its origin from which we learn thatThe principal personage in this farce, is a certain Jo Smith, an ignorant, and nearly unlettered young man, living at, or near the village of Palmyra; the second, an itinerant pamphlet pedlar, and occasionally, a journeyman printer, name Oliver Cowdry; and third, Martin Harris, a respectable farmer at Palmyra. Others less important actors, have been brought in, as the exigencies of the case required. About two years since, Smith pretended to have been directed, in a dream, or vision, to a certain spot located between the village of Palmyra and Manchester. A slight excavation of the earth, enabled him to arrive at this new revelation, written in mysterious characters, upon gold plates. A pair of spectacles, of strange and peculiar construction were found with the plates, to aid the optics of the prophet. Soon after another very fortunate circumstance occurred. This was the introduction of Oliver Cowdry, to whom, and whom only, was given the ability—with the aid of spectacles—to translate the mysterious characters; all this arranged, but one thing was wanting to promulgate the new revelation—money. Martin Harris was possessed of a valuable farm, acquired by industry and economy; in religion he was a credulous zealot. His credulity and his money, were too conspicuous to be overlooked by the modern apostles. In due time, a divine command came to Harris, through Jo, to devote his property, and all that was his,to the project. Harris’ farm was mortgaged, and the printing of the Bible executed. It is a book of over 300 pages, and is entitled “Book of Mormon.” Of the book, it is only necessary to say that it is a ridiculous imitation of the manner of the Holy Scriptures; and in many instances, a plagiarism upon their language. With all its glaring inconsistencies, it can hardly claim the poor merit of common ingenuity. The projectors of the scheme have attempted to connect a story, historically consistent. The surmise, connected with the destruction of Babylon, is brought to their aid, that a portion of the Jews, wandered to this continent, and by Divine command, deposited the “Book of Mormon,” in the obscure spot, where the lucky stars of Jo Smith directed him.It is supposed that there were already more than a thousand persons carried away with this strange delusion. Their prophet selected a place in the town of Kirtland, Geneva county, which he called “the promised land.”Hither the deluded followers of the false prophet, repaired by boat loads along the canal, principally from the counties of Ontario and Wayne. Such as have property, convert it to a common stock, and thus create an inducement which is not overlooked by the idle and vicious. Families, in some instances, have been divided, and in others, mothers have been obliged to follow their deluded husbands, or adopt the disagreeable alternative, of parting with them and their children.We have never seen the “Book of Mormon,” and are not fully informed of all the peculiar tenets of the sect. The most important or cardinal doctrine is implicit faith in their leaders, Smith and Cowdry. The following statement is from the Painesville, Ohio, Gazette.They profess to receive sensible demonstrations of the Diety. A few days since, a young man gave information to some of his brethren that he was about to receive a mesage from heaven. They repaired to the spot designated, and there, as they solemnly assert, a letter descended from the skies, and fell into the hands of the young man. The purport was to strengthen his faith and inform him that he would soon be called to the ministry. They declare their solemn belief that this letter was written in heaven by the finger of God. The style of writing was the round Italian, and the letters of gold. They favored youth immediately attempted to copy the communication, but as fast as he wrote the letters of the original disappeared.It is alleged, that some of them have received white stones, promised in the second chapter of the Revelation. Such of them as have “the spirit,” will declare that they see a white stone moving about the upper part of the room, and will jump and spring for it, until one more fortunate than the others catches it, but he alone can see it. Others, however, profess to hear it roll across the floor. These two stories and others of a similar character, are told by them with solemn asserverations of their truth.Among them is a man of color, a chief man who is sometimes seized with strong vagaries and odd conceits. The other day he is said to have jumped twenty-five feet down a wash bank into a tree top without injury. He sometimes fancies he can fly.In Chardon,one man has torn away all the partitions of the lower part of a good two story dwelling house. Here a large number live together. The food consisting in meat and vegetables, it is said, is placed on the table in a large pan, which is the whole table furniture. From this every inmate takes a piece of meat and a potato in his hand, and devours them as he walks about the room. As to matters of apparel, and indeed other things, when any one wants what he has not, he takes it any where in the family where he can find it unoccupied. All things are common.They are now extending their operation into different parts of the country. In Albany, we learn that they have made several proselytes, who have occasioned much trouble to the churches, with which some of them had been connected. We have before us a letter from one of them, dated in Bradford county, Pa. August, 1832. The writer says,Sir—The prayer of my heart to God is, that you may believe the Scriptures of the Old and New Testament, if you do not believe what I write. But I now tell you what has taken place since I arrived here. On the 30th of July, there was an appointment for preaching at 4 o’clock P.M. by a Methodist. We went to the place but he did not attend; and we occupied the time by prayer and exhortation. The company were Methodists, and a class of people called Mormonites. After the meeting was over,notice was given that there would be a meeting in the evening at my brother’s house. Some of the Mormonites, together with others, collected, and the meeting commenced and went on the same as your meetings do, until about 10 o’clock, when I should say by what I saw and felt, of a truth the Lord was present with us. The spirit seemed to rest and clothe upon a Mrs. Conkling, and I thought, and think yet, that I heard a few words of a language that I could not understand. You must know that my mind was on the look out. And not long after, perhaps forty-five minutes, she broke forth in prayer to God, in a language that I could not understand, and continued two or three minutes, and then in our language, she gave an interpretation of what she had said. Then she broke out again, in the same language, and was more lengthy than the first time. This last prayer or exhortation she did not interpret. I am credibly informed that they have these gifts, and all the gifts of the gospel. I trust that I shall see and hear more yet; when I do I will write. I leave all to God, whether you believe or disbelieve.More recently their emissaries have showed themselves in Boston, where the delusion has seized several respectable citizens, some of whom were considered worthy members of different churches. The Rev. J. V. Himes makes the following statement.However strange to relate, about fifteen persons in this city have been led away by these false doctrines, have been baptized, and joined the Mormon church. And some of these persons have set out for “the promised land, the place of refuge for the house of Israel and for all the Gentile world, who will take warning and flee thither for safety.” Two individuals who have gone, are defenceless females, they had acquired by their hard industry $2,300, one having $1,500 the other $800 which they had given up to go into the general stock. One of these females was in a consumption, and her friends thought she would not live to reach her destined place. Her afflicted sister told me that if she had been buried here before she had been led away by these errors, and had satisfactory evidence that she was prepared to die, her grief would have been far less than it is now. The remaining persons who were baptized, and joined the church, and contemplate going to the West, possess between 3,000 and $4,000, which they also are going to put with the general fund, and which they can never draw out again, should they get sick of Mormonism, and wish to return to their friends. Thus are our friends swindled out of their property and drawn from their comfortable homes to endure the perils of a journey of about two thousand miles, by these ignorant fanatics;and when arrived at their earthly paradise, to become the miserable dupes of these temporal and spiritual lords.
